Here's a snippet from Reflector</p>

<li><p>Do anybody know how OpenVPN send packets from client to server, and from server to target.

<li><p>Can I inject packets to send other locations, or by default received packet moves towards application layer?</p></li>

<li><p>I coulnt forward traffic at server Tap so to fasten things I used Java socket programming between client-server.</p></li>

<p>Now I read packets from socket at server, and try to OpenVPN Tap driver's write method to move forward but I am not sure where do I fail. I see packets with tcpdump at server tap0, but they do not pass to server eth0.</p>

<p>My most important question is if I modify packet(ip, mac address) and call write method, is it possible that packet moves forward. (Or does it move to application layer whatever you change??)</p>

<p>One of my industrious coworkers has replaced all the strings throughout our application with constants that are contained in a dictionary.  That dictionary gets various strings placed in it once the user selects a language (English by default, but target languages are German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Mandarin, and Thai).</p>

<p>For our test of this functionality, we wanted to change a button to include text which has a ñ character, which appears both in Spanish and in the Arial Unicode MS font (which we're using throughout the application).</p>

<p>Problem is, the ñ is appearing as a square block, as if the program did not know how to display it.  When I debug into that particular string being read from disk, the debugger reports that character as a square block as well.</p>

<p>So where is the failure?  I think it could be in a few places:</p>

<p>1) Notepad may not be unicode aware, so the ñ displayed there is not the same as what vs2008 expects, and so the program interprets the character as a square (EDIT: notepad shows the same characters as vs; ie, they both show the ñ.  In the same place.).</p>

<p>2) vs2008 can't handle ñ.  I find that very, very hard to believe.</p>

<p>3) The text is read in properly, but the default font for vs2008 can't display it, which is why the debugger shows a square.</p>

<p>4) The text is not read in properly, and I should use something other than a regular StreamReader to get strings.</p>

<p>5) The text is read in properly, but the default String class in C# doesn't handle ñ well.  I find that very, very hard to believe.</p>

<p>6) The version of Arial Unicode MS I have doesn't have ñ, despite it being listed as one of the 50k characters by <a href=""http://www.fileinfo.info"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.fileinfo.info</a>.</p>

The structures is the same for every Location directive except for the directories the files are served from. What I currently have is a large file that looks something like this:</p>

I wanted to have a simple task monitor that would list the task name and the task’s status. I need this to look just a little nice, I’m no designer so whatever I do is going to suck, but a basic text display won’t work for the project requirements.</p>

<p>What I am essentially attempting to do is show something similar to the Firefox download window, the I-Tunes download window, and well I could name more but they all look basically the same. In each of these apps, each of the ‘progress panels’ is selectable. So to implement this I thought it would be simple to just use a list of JPanels each with a JProgressBar and a JLabel, each of which can just accept focus to determine if it and others are selected. I thought this was going to be an easy task, but if I use a JList it just displays text. I then just figured I would show all the task panels in a larger panel, but I cannot get the inner panels to recognize focus.</p>

<p>Is there a pattern for this? Is there a rolled standard solution that I just have not found? Or is there a better method for doing this? I don’t want to re-invent the wheel, but I thought this was just going to be simple.</p>

I have a singular table (<code>Entity</code>) that have it's <code>id</code> on several other tables as the Foreign Key <code>entity_id</code></p>

<p>Some tables are one to one relations (Like a <code>Company</code> is one <code>Entity</code>) and some are one to many (<code>Entity</code> can have several <code>Addresses</code>) and so on.</p>

<p><em>I won't/can't change the database model</em>, so this is the structure.</p>

<p>I have been using <code>saveAll()</code> to save data on those tables with input names like:</p>

<pre><code>Entity.type='x' (hidden inside the view)
Company.name
Address.0.street
Address.0.city
Address.1.street
Address.1.city

... and so on ...
</code></pre>

<p>and my save all is doing all the hard job, <code>BEGIN TRANSACTION</code>, all <code>INSERT</code>s and a final <code>COMMIT</code> ...</p>

<p>But now I've created a <code>EntityCategory</code> that is a n to n  relation and created the full <code>HABTM</code> relation inside the model.</p>

<p>It works when I <code>save()</code> it but just the <code>HABTM</code> relation, and it saves everthing when I use <code>saveAll()</code> (just as before) except for the <code>HABTM</code> relation.</p>

<p>Am I missing something ? How I make this work correctly ? I am using the following code today:</p>

<pre><code>if (!empty($this-&gt;data)) {
  $this-&gt;Entity-&gt;saveAll($this-&gt;data);
  $this-&gt;Entity-&gt;save($this-&gt;data);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>saveAll()</code> saves all data in several tables, saves the id in <code>Entity-&gt;id</code> and the <code>save()</code> saves the <code>HABTM</code> relations, but I am not sure if it is correct or if it can bring me problems if I change some structure/model.</p>

<p>Is this the best way to use it? Is there a <em>correct</em> way to save that relations inside CakePHP ? What your experience/knowledge can tell me ?</p>

<p>This output is read from a VB.NET program by using HttpWebRequest, HttpWebResponse, and a StreamReader.</p>

<p>The problem is that some of the file names being output contain... unusual characters. Specifically, the ""section"" symbol (§). </p>

<p>If I view the output of the PHP script in a web browser, the symbol appears fine.</p>

<p>But when I read the output of the PHP script into my .NET program, the symbol doesn't appear correctly (it appears as a generic ""block"" symbol). </p>

<p>I've tried all the different character encoding options that you can use when reading the response stream (from the HttpWebResponse). I've tried outputting the stream directly to a text file (no good), displaying it in a TextBox (no good), and even when viewing the results directly in the Visual Studio debugger, the character appears as a block instead of as the ""section"" symbol. </p>

<p>I've examined the output in a hex editor (as suggested by a related question, ""<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29499/how-do-you-troubleshoot-character-encoding-problems"">how do you troubleshoot character encoding problems</a>."" </p>

<p>When I write out the section symbol (§) from .NET itself, the hex bytes I see representing it are ""c2 a7"" (makes sense if it's unicode, right? requires two bytes?). When I write out the output from the PHP script directly to a file and examine that with a hex editor, the symbol shows up as ""ef bf bd"" - three bytes instead of two?</p>

<p>I'm at a loss as to what to do - if I need to specify some other character encoding, or if I'm missing something obvious about this. </p>

<p>Here's the code that's used to get the output of the PHP script (VB-style comments modified so they appear correctly on this site):</p>

<pre><code>
Dim myRequest As HttpWebRequest = WebRequest.Create(""http://www.example.com/sample.php"")

Dim myResponse As HttpWebResponse = myRequest.GetResponse()

// read the response stream
Dim myReader As New StreamReader(myResponse.GetResponseStream())

// read the entire output in one block (just as an example)
Dim theOutput as String = myReader.ReadToEnd()
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas? </p>

<ul>
<li>Am I using the wrong kind of StreamReader? (I've tried passing the character encoding in the call to create the new StreamReader - I've tried all the ones that are in System.Text.Encoding - UTF-8, UTF-7, ASCII, UTF-32, Unicode, etc.)</li>
<li>Should I be using a different method for reading the output of the PHP script? </li>
<li>Is there something I should be doing different on the PHP-side when outputting the text?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>UPDATED INFO:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The output from PHP is specifically encoded UTF-8 by calling: <code>utf8_encode($file);</code></li>
<li>When I wrote out the symbol from .NET, I copied and pasted the symbol from the Character Map app in Windows. I also copied &amp; pasted it directly from the file's name (in Windows) and from this web page itself - all gave the same hex value when written out (c2 a7).</li>
<li>Yes, the ""section symbol"" I'm talking about is U+00A7 (ALT+0167 on Windows, according to Character Map).</li>
<li>The content-type is set explicitly via <code>header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8');</code> right at the beginning of the PHP script.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Create a new iPhone application project, using the Utility Application template</li>
<li>In Interface Builder, rotate all the views 90 degrees.</li>
<li>In Interface Builder, add a label to the middle of the MainView.  Stretch it all the way across the view, set the alignment to centered, and set the autosizing springs so that it can stretch horizontally.</li>
<li>In Info.plist, add the key ""UIInterfaceOrientation"" with value ""UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight""</li>
<li>In the controller classes, change the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation methods to ""return (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight) || (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft);""</li>
<li>Run the app. </li>
</ul>

<p>When I launch my app, it comes up in landscape orientation, but the main view only covers the top half of the display, and it is stretched horizontally.  I get the same results in both the simulator and on an actual device.  I've seen it with versions 2.2 and 2.2.1 of the SDK.</p>

<p>I have been able to work around the problem by adding the following step to the above:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add ""self.view.autoresizesSubviews = NO;"" to RootViewController's viewDidLoad method after ""[super viewDidLoad];"".</li>
</ul>

<p>If I do this, then it works as expected. But this feels like a hack. Why should this be necessary?</p>

<p>I don't think it is a transformation issue.  All elements are drawn in the proper orientation and with the proper scaling.  The problem seems to be that the bounds rectangles of the main view gets funky.  It looks like the height of the main view is being cut by a little more than half, and the width is being increased by about 50%.</p>

<p>If I do the exact same set of steps using the View-based Application template instead of Utility, then everything works as expected.  So I'm pretty sure the problem is specific to how a Utility application manages its views.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>My apologies, I should clarify what functionality I thought were useful in the Ada implementation of the Enum. Given the enumeration</p>

<pre><code>type fruit is (apple, banana, cherry, peach, grape);
</code></pre>

<p>We know that fruit is one of the listed fruits: apple, banana, cherry, peach, grape. Nothing really different there from C++.</p>

<p>What is very useful are the following pieces of functionality that you get with every enum in Ada without any additional work:</p>

<ul>
<li>printing out an enumerated value generates the string version </li>
<li>you can increment the enumerated variable</li>
<li>you can decrement the enumerated variable</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope this defines the problem a bit more.</p>

<li>The decrement operation is <code>fruit'pred(cherry)</code> which also gives <code>banana</code>.</li>
<li>The conversion from enumeration to integer is <code>fruit'pos(cherry)</code> which returns <code>2</code> because Ada uses 0-based enumerations.</li>
<li>The conversion from integer to enumeration is <code>fruit'val(2)</code> which returns <code>cherry</code>.</li>
<li>The conversion from enumeration to string is <code>fruit'Image(apple)</code> which returns the (upper-case) string <code>""APPLE""</code>.</li>

<p>Suppose we have an event that adds either an anonymous delegate or a lambda expression (for you lucky crowds that can use newer versions of .NET). </p>

<pre><code>SomeClass.SomeEvent += delegate(object o, EventArg e) { /* do something */ };

<p>I have read that people in the past have forgotten about events that still have handlers which prevent the class from being garbage collected. How would one go about removing the added handler without just setting SomeEvent to null within the class. Wouldn't the following be an entirely new handler?</p>

<pre><code>SomeClass.SomeEvent -= delegate(object o, EventArg e) { /* do something */ };

<p>I could see storing the anonymous delegate or lambda expression in a variable. But that, to me at least, seems to defeat the entire purpose of being able to simply and succinctly add an event handler.</p>

SomeClass.SomeEvent += handler;
// ... stuff

<p>So, the application is a long-running server, and I'd like to improve its performance and scalability, I was looking to improve data access among other things. I posted in another thread about second-level caching.</p>

<p>This post is about session management for the long-running thread that accesses the database. 
Should I be using a thread-static context?
If so, is there any example of how that would be implemented. </p>

<p>Every one around the net who is using NHibernate seem to be heavily focussed on web-application style architectures. There seems to be a great lack of documentation / discussion for non-web app designs.</p>

<p>At the moment, my long running thread does this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Call 3 or 4 DAO methods</li>
<li>Verify the state of the detached objects returned.</li>
<li>Update the state if needed.</li>
<li>Call a couple of DAO methods to persist the updated instances. (pass in the id of the object and the instance itself - the DAO will retrieve the object from the DB again, and set the updated values and session.SaveOrUpdate() before committing the transaction.</li>
<li>Sleep for 'n' seconds</li>
<li>Repeat all over again!</li>
</ol>

<p>So, the following is a common pattern we use for each of the DAO methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open session using sessionFactory.OpenSession()</li>
<li>Begin transaction</li>
<li>Do db work. retrieve / update etc</li>
<li>Commit trans</li>
<li>(Rollback in case of exceptions)</li>
<li>Finally always dispose transaction and session.Close()</li>
</ul>

<p>This happens for <em>every</em> method call to a DAO class.
I suspect this is some sort of an anti-pattern the way we are doing it.</p>

<p>However, I'm not able to find enough direction anywhere as to how we could improve it.</p>

<p>Pls note, while this thread is running in the background, doing its stuff, there are requests coming in from the WCF clients each of which could make 2-3 DAO calls themselves - sometimes querying/updating the same objects the long running thread deals with.</p>

<p>Any ideas / suggestions / pointers to improve our design will be greatly appreciated.
If we can get some good discussion going, we could make this a community wiki, and possbily link to here from <a href=""http://nhibernate.info"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://nhibernate.info</a></p>

<p>Note: I finally changed the dialog so that I don't need to make it transparent. Anyway, I add this information because maybe someone is still trying to do it. The groupbox isn't a CStatic but a CButton (I know this is not new). I changed the Windows XP theme to Windows classic and then the groupbox backgraund was transparent. The bad new is that in this case the frame line gets visible beneath the text...so if someone is following this approach I think maybe he/she would better follow the Adzm's advice.   </p>

<p>If you have a simple RSS reader with a database, you might have a couple of tables for storing feeds (ignoring dealing with subscribers here):</p>

<ul>
<li>Feeds (<strong>feed-id</strong>, feed-title,
feed-url)</li>
<li>Items (<strong>item-id</strong>, <em>feed-id</em>,
item-title, item-content)</li>
</ul>

<p>This works in most cases but for many websites/web based applications you might have a main feed from the frontpage and then category feeds, if you take both into the above sort of system there's going to be a lot of replicated data due to the same post appearing in several rss feeds. </p>

<p>The two choices I've come up with are either ignore it and accept the duplicates or use a link table between the feeds and the items. But this also seems like quite a waste when probably 80% of the sort of feeds I'm looking to pull won't have multiple feeds which could create this replication.</p>

<p>Is there a better way of doing this/am I looking at this in completely the wrong way?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to both for the answers, so the consensus seems to be that the saving on space is probably not significant enough to worry about and would be negated by the potential for unknown issues (such as mentioned by dbr). </p>

<p>Adding a link table or similar would probably increase the processing time as well so overall not worth worrying about too much. I had thoughts after reading the responses of linking content and removing duplicates only when the post is no longer in either RSS feed to save on space but again as Assaf has said, the space savings could make this a waste of time.</p>

        public void TestClear() 
        {
            List&lt;Control&gt; listofcontrols = new List&lt;Control&gt;();

            TextBox textbox4 = new TextBox() { Text = ""Hello World"" };

            listofcontrols.Add(textbox1);
            listofcontrols.Add(textbox2);
            listofcontrols.Add(textbox3);
            listofcontrols.Add(textbox4);

            foreach (Control control in listofcontrols)

<p>Should I be adding a referance to System.Window.Forms to my unit test and use the real Textbox  object? or am I doing it wrong? </p>

<ul>
<li>Access to JVM heap is random from the OS/hypervisor perspective</li>
<li>It is difficult to for guest OS or hypervisor to optimize memory that is randomly accessed</li>
<li>Given this, can the hypervisor detect unused pages in JVM heap?</li>
</ul>

<p>The conventional wisdom for Java server applications is that performance is best if you allocate all the heap at JVM startup, rather than allowing the heap to be dynamically resized as the need arises. In other words, if you set the heap size to 1GB, your Java process will grab 1GB of contiguous virtual address space (+ whatever is needed for the binaries), memory which is no longer available to other applications.</p>

<p>Is VMware smart enough to detect that some of this heap is in fact unused? How does this affect GC performance? Would it be better to let the heap be dynamically resized in VMware? What GC strategies work best with VMware guests?</p>

<p>Also, would anyone point me towards guidelines for tuning JVM heaps in virtualized environments?</p>

<pre><code>[self.navigationController pushViewController:someController animated:YES];

<p>I have prepared an OpenGL-based view that performs an effect on some static texture mapped to a plane (let's say it's a copy of the flip effect in Core Animation).  What I don't know how to do is:</p>

<ul>
<li>grab current view content and make a texture out of it (I remember seeing a function that does just that, but can't find it)</li>
<li>how to do the same for the view that is currently offscreen and is going to replace current view </li>
<li>are there some APIs I can hook to in order to make my transition class as native as possible (make it a kind of Core Animation effect)?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Jeffrey Forbes's answer works great as a solution to capture the content of a view.  </p>

<p>What I haven't figured out yet is how to capture the content of the view I want to transition to, which should be invisible until the transition is done.</p>

<p>Also, which method should I use to present the OpenGL view?
For demonstration purposes I used pushViewController.  That affects the navbar, though, which I actually want to go one item back, with animation, check this vid for explanation:</p>

<p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/4649397"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://vimeo.com/4649397</a>.</p>

<p>Another option would be to go with presentViewController, but that shows fullscreen.
Do you think maybe creating another window (or view?) could be useful?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>(Note there may be multiple <code>&lt;subreport&gt;</code> elements and within those, multiple <code>&lt;record&gt;</code> elements.)</p>

<p>What I'd like is to extract the <code>&lt;value&gt;</code> tags of two documents and then compare their values.  That part I know how to do.  The problem is the extraction itself.</p>

<p>Since I'm stuck in C++, I'm using MSXML, and have written a wrapper to allow my app to abstract away the actual XML manipulation, in case I ever decide to change my data format.</p>

<p>That wrapper, CSimpleXMLParser, loads an XML document and sets its ""top record"" to the document element of the XML document. (CRecord being an abstract class with CXMLRecord one of its subclasses, and which gives access to child records singularly or by group, and also allowing access to the ""value"" of the Record (values for child elements or attributes, in the case of CXMLRecord.)  A CXMLRecord contains an MSXML::MSXMLDOMNodePtr and a pointer to an instance of a CSimpleXMLParser.)  The wrapper also contains utility functions for returning children, which the CXMLRecord uses to return its child records.</p>

<p>In my code, I do the following (trying to return all <code>&lt;subreport&gt;</code> nodes just to see if it works):</p>

<pre><code>CSimpleXMLParser parserReportData;
parserReportData.OpenXMLDocument(strPathToXML);
bool bGetChildrenSuccess = parserReportData.GetFirstRecord()-&gt;GetChildRecords(listpChildren, _T(""subreport""));
</code></pre>

<p>This is always returning false.  The meat of the implementation of CXMLRecord::GetChildRecords() is basically</p>

<pre><code>MSXML2::IXMLDOMNodeListPtr pListChildren = m_pParser-&gt;SelectNodes(strPath, m_pXMLNode);

if (pListChildren-&gt;Getlength() == 0)
{
    return false;
}

for (long l = 0; l &lt; pListChildren-&gt;Getlength(); ++l)
{
    listRecords.push_back(new CXMLRecord(pListChildren-&gt;Getitem(l), m_pParser));
}

return true;
</code></pre>

<p>And CSimpleXMLParser::SelectNodes() is:</p>

<pre><code>MSXML2::IXMLDOMNodeListPtr CSimpleXMLParser::SelectNodes(LPCTSTR strXPathFilter, MSXML2::IXMLDOMNodePtr pXMLNode)
{
    return pXMLNode-&gt;selectNodes(_bstr_t(strXPathFilter));
}
</code></pre>

<p>When run, the top record is definitely being set to the <code>&lt;report&gt;</code> element properly.  I can do all sorts of things with it, like getting its child nodes (through the MSXML interface, not through my wrapper) or its name, etc.  I know that my wrapper <em>can</em> work, because I use it elsewhere in the app for parsing an XML configuration file, and that works flawlessly.</p>

<p>I thought maybe I was doing something faulty with the XPath query expression, but every permutation I could think of gives no joy.  The <code>MSXML::IXMLDOMNodeListPtr</code> returned by <code>IXMLDOMNodePtr::SelectNodes()</code> is always of length 0 when I try to deal with this XML file.</p>

<p>This is driving me crazy.</p>

People tend to suggest using a known trick which is commonly used for showing TForm descendant's properties on the Object inspector. The trick is: registering custom module for TForm descendants to Delphi IDE via design time package like:</p>

<pre><code>RegisterCustomModule(TMyFrame, TCustomModule);
</code></pre>

<p>The object inspector can show additional properties of the TFrame Descendant's instance with this way but it loses its frame behaviours while it is embedded in a form. Not redesignable, not possible to implement events for its subcomponents and it accepts child controls (which it musn't). But it behaves normally in its own design area.</p>

<p>Looks like, those behaviours provided by Delphi IDE specially just for TFrame. They problaly are not kind of generic facilities. </p>

<p>Is there any other way to accomplish this without losing frame behaviours  ?</p>

My understanding was that <code>locpoly</code> just takes a fixed bandwidth argument, while <code>locfit</code> can also include a varying part in its smoothing parameter (a nearest-neighbors fraction, ""<code>nn</code>"").  I thought setting this varying part to zero in <code>locfit</code> should make the ""<code>h</code>"" component act like the fixed bandwidth used in <code>locpoly</code>, but this is evidently not the case.      </p>

<p>A working example:</p>

<pre><code>library(KernSmooth)
library(locfit)
set.seed(314)

n &lt;- 100
x &lt;- runif(n, 0, 1)
eps &lt;- rnorm(n, 0, 1)
y &lt;- sin(2 * pi * x) + eps

plot(x, y)
lines(locpoly(x, y, bandwidth=0.05, degree=1), col=3)
lines(locfit(y ~ lp(x, nn=0, h=0.05, deg=1)), col=4)
</code></pre>

<p>Produces this plot:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/U62pczY.png"" alt=""plot of smoothers""></p>

<p><code>locpoly</code> gives the smooth green line, and <code>locfit</code> gives the wiggly blue line.  Clearly, <code>locfit</code> has a smaller ""effective"" bandwidth here, even though the supposed bandwidth parameter has the same value for each.</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>

<p>An invalid argument (for example, an argument that specified an invalid level) was supplied to the setsockopt (Wsapiref_94aa.asp) function. Sometimes, it also refers to the current state of the sockets, for example, calling accept (Wsapiref_13aq.asp) on a socket that is not listening. </p>

<p>But I have set the correct option value and size.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? I am using Windows XP (SP3). In setsocketopt I tried IP_OPTIONS for that program it works fine and it sends IP Packets too. But in ethereal for every IP packet it generates ICMP packets from the destination. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;exampleForm-&gt;example; ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine, except for it generates the field like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""example"" value=""""&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is obviously because I set the element decorators to include HtmlTag: tag => 'li'.</p>

<p><strong>My question is: How can I disable all decorators for this element. I don't need decorators for hidden input elements.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>I'm not asking how to call C# from IronPython. The easiest documentation to find describes how to call C# from inside IronPython.  (For example, the tutorial that ships with IronPython.) I want to do the opposite, call IronPython from C#. </p></li>
<li><p>I'm not asking how to embed the IronPython interpreter.  I've found several useful references (e.g. <a href=""http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/berniea/archive/2008/12/04/extending-your-c-application-with-ironpython.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""http://lists.ironpython.com/pipermail/users-ironpython.com/2005-July/000855.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>) on how to call the IronPython interpreter from C#.  That's helpful, but I'm more interested in creating a compiled assembly from IronPython.  That is, I'd like to make method calls into the IronPython assembly rather than passing source code strings to the interpreter.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Once I've created the assembly, what are some tips on calling into it?  One <a href=""http://www.sogeti-phoenix.com/Blogs/post/2008/03/Creating-and-Consuming-IronPython-Assemblies.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">blog post</a> I found said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... calling a Python assembly from C#
  is non-trivial. That python assembly
  contains dynamic types, which are not
  easily reflected into useful C#
  objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you know any sort of cheat sheet for passing basic data types between IronPython and C#?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The scenario I am most interested in for now is passing two or three <code>double</code> values into Python and getting one or two <code>double</code> values back.  If I could pass in a string and get a string back that would be terrific, but my first priority is just passing numbers back and forth.</p>

The data structure will be used to store anything from a few to several million objects, and no sorting is required (though a unique sort key can be provided very cheaply).</p>

<p>The requirements are that it can support efficient insert, ideally O(1), moderately efficient removal, and efficient traversal.  It doesn't need to support a find operation (other than might be needed for removal).</p>

<p>The twist is that it must be thread safe with respect to modifications while other threads are enumerating the data structure.  This means that a simple red-black tree doesn't work, since one thread can't insert an element (and perform the necessary tree rotations) without messing up any cursors held by other threads.</p>

<p>It is <strong>not</strong> acceptable to use a read/write lock and defer the write operations until all readers have finished, since read operations may be long lived.  It doesn't matter if inserts that happen while there is a reader are visible to that reader or not.</p>

<p>Memory footprint is also very important, and small is obviously better!</p>

<p>What suggestions are there?</p>

<p><strong>Response to comments:</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for the answers.</p>

<p>No, inserts cannot invalidate existing iterators.  Iterators may or may not see the new insert, but they must see everything that they would have seen if the insert hadn't occurred.</p>

<p>Deletion is required, however due to higher level rules I can guarantee that a iterator will never be stopped on an item that is available for deletion.</p>

<p>Locking per node for a cursor would have too great an impact on performance.  There may be a number of threads reading at once, and any kind of memory hot spot that multiple threads are using in a lock kills memory bandwidth (as we discovered the hard way!).  Even a simple count of readers with multiple threads calling InterlockedIncrement fails to scale cleanly.  </p>

<p>I agree a linked list is likely the best approach.  Deletes are rare, so paying the memory penalty for the back pointers to support O(1) delete is costly and we may compute those separately on demand and since deletes tend to be batch operations.</p>

<p>Fortunately insertion into a linked list doesn't require any locking for readers, as long as the pointers are updated in the inserted node before the head pointer is changed.</p>

<p>The lock-copy-unlock idea is interesting.  The amount of data involved is too large for this to work as the default for readers, but it could be used for writers when they collide with readers.  A read/write lock would protect the whole structure, and the write would clone the data structure if it collides with a reader.  Writes are much rarer than reads.</p>

The question is related to general accounting practices, I have a fact table containing financial transactions (i.e. a ledger) and each of those transactions is tagged with a transaction date and a period.  The period does NOT related directly to a day, or a series of days.  Users may close a period in the middle of a day if that is when they have finished their months work.  </p>

<p>I need to be able to report on Accounts Receivable (AR) by both date and period.  I am not using Enterprise Edition of SSAS so the time intelligence semi-additive options are not availabe to me, and even if they were they would only allow one time dimension to use non-standard aggregation and I believe in this case I need two that allow this.</p>

<p>Accounts Receivable is a running total, it should be the sum of the latest ledger item selected and everything that came before it.  I know how do do this calculation in MDX for a single time dimension, but how can I allow this to work with two time dimensions, transaction date, and period close?  Is period close even considered a ""time"" dimension in this case?  It does have a temporal aspect to it, and I do want the sums from all periods up to the current.</p>

<p>I am stumped on how to related the two time dimensions to a single fact table and use different aggregation for each.  Maybe the best solution here is to have two periodic snapshot tables (instead of trying to aggregate this info from the FactLedger table), one aggregated by transaction date and one by period which is the solution I am currently leaning towards but I would love a second opinion.</p>

Specifically:</p>

<pre><code>var familiesWithNoPledges = from family in entities.Family.Include(""Pledge"")

<p>When the user of the application selects a family from the first ListBox, the ListBox item expands slightly to show the fields for a pledge, so that it's easy to add the pledge details to the second ListBox.  It looks something like this:</p>

<p>But I can't figure out how to do that.  If I try to do it in the code-behind, it doesn't seem like the event handler for the (n-instances of the) ""Add Pledge"" button can reference the controls in question; and in XAML, if I try to bind the ListBoxItem DataTemplate controls to the Family.Pledge (or Family.Pledge.FirstOrDefault()) fields, those fields are still empty when I look at the current Family object in the event handler for the Add Pledge button.</p>

For example, www.example.com/home.do stays English, but www.example.com/es/home.do is Spanish.  My first thought was to create a Filter which rewrites incoming urls like /es/home.do to /home.do (and sets the Locale in the Request); this works fine.  The Filter wraps the ServletRequest with an HttpServletRequestWrapper which overrides getContextPath() to return the language:</p>

<pre><code>class FakeContextRequest extends HttpServletRequestWrapper {

  private String context = """";
  FakeContextRequest(HttpServletRequest request, String context) {
    super(request);
    // snip some validation code
    this.context = request.getContextPath() + context;
  }
  @Override
  public String getContextPath() {
    return this.context;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My Filter forwards to the appropriate request as follows:</p>

<pre><code>FakeContextRequest fr = new FakeContextRequest(request, lang);
fr.getRequestDispatcher(newResourceName).forward(fr, response);
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is that the next servlet doesn't forward properly.  The next servlet (typically a Struts ActionServlet) forwards to a JSP (often using Struts Tiles); when I get to the JSP the HttpServletRequest has been wrapped several times and the object in question reports the context to be empty (the root context, which is where the application is actually deployed).</p>

<p>I want the context to be re-written so that all my context-aware code that already exists can automatically insert the language into the URLs that are written.  Is this possible?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I solved my problem by using a wrapped HttpServletResponse instead of a wrapped HttpServletRequest; I rewrite the URL in the response.encodeURL() method.</p>

I can push my values into the queue, the <code>top()</code> of the queue is what I would expect and accessible. <code>pop()</code>, when it goes to re-heap, seems to have a problem.</p>

<p>I am storing pointers to a templated class in the queue. I have the comparision overloaded:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The overload works in the fashion it does, because a negative distance is considered infinity, always larger than whatever else; to represent infinity, distances are initialized to -1. The queue needs to keep the smallest, but non-negative at the top.</p>

<p>I dereference the pointers in the overload, is what I'm doing there allowable? And, is there another operator I need to overload?</p>

<p>I would attach code, but it seems if I do, it scares people away. Request to see more and I'll attach to another message.</p>

<p>I dynamically declare an array of pointers to pointers, these are what get pushed, because I assume <code>priority_queue</code> stores by reference, so if I just put a pointer declared in the loop into the queue, that pointer goes out of scope. These pointers point to the proper <code>Vertex&lt;type&gt;</code>, and exist throughout the function.</p>

<p>We have made several attempts at building unit tests around some of our key stored procedures (primarily testing the performance), but have found that setting up the test data for these tests is really hard.

In addition to this, the tests end up being really sensitive to change, and even the smallest change to a stored proc. or table requires a large amount of changes to the tests. So after many builds breaking due to these database tests failing intermittently, we’ve just had to pull them out of the build process.</p>

<p>Binding works.  The issue is that the XpsDocumentWriter doesn't properly write the first page of the first document of a FixedDocumentSequence.  This seems to be an issue encountered by lots of people doing this sort of thing (i.e., five developers worldwide).  The solution is slightly odd.  I include it as an answer.</p>

<hr>

<p>Okay, its a bit more subtle than the question suggests.</p>

<p>I've got a series of FixedPages, each has its DataContext set individually.  Each FixedPage also has one or more controls that are bound to the context.</p>

<p>If I add these FixedPages to a single FixedDocument and write this single FixedDocument to an XpsDocument, my binds are de-referenced (so to speak) and the correct values are presented in the XpsDocument.</p>

<p>If I add these FixedPages to individual FixedDocuments (each FP gets added to a new FD), then these FixedDocuments are added to a FixedDocumentSequence, and this sequence is then written to the XpsDocument, my binds are NOT de-referenced and my FixedPages appear blank.</p>

<p>Debugging tells me that I'm not losing my bindings or my binding context, so that's not the cause of this failure.</p>

<p>Here's some sample code to illustrate what's going on:</p>

<pre><code>// This works
FixedPage fp = CreateFixedPageWithBinding();
fp.DataContext = CreateDataContext();
// Add my databound fixed page to a new fixed document
var fd = new FixedDocument();
var pc = new PageContent();
((IAddChild)pc).AddChild(fp);
fd.Pages.Add(pageContent);
// Create an xps document and write my fixed document to it
var p = Package.Open(""c:\\output.xps"", FileMode.CreateNew);
var doc = new XpsDocument(p);
var writer = XpsDocument.CreateXpsDocumentWriter(doc);
wri2.Write(fd);
p.Flush();
p.Close();

// This does NOT work
FixedPage fp = CreateFixedPageWithBinding();
fp.DataContext = CreateDataContext();
// Add my databound fixed page to a new fixed document
var fd = new FixedDocument();
var pc = new PageContent();
((IAddChild)pc).AddChild(fp);
fd.Pages.Add(pageContent);
// Create a fixed document sequence and add the fixed document to it
FixedDocumentSequence fds = CreateFixedDocumentSequence();
var dr = new DocumentReference();
dr.BeginInit();
dr.SetDocument(fd);
dr.EndInit();
(fds as IAddChild).AddChild(dr);
// Create an xps document and write the fixed document sequence to it
var p = Package.Open(""c:\\output.xps"", FileMode.CreateNew);
var doc = new XpsDocument(p);
var writer = XpsDocument.CreateXpsDocumentWriter(doc);
wri2.Write(fds);
p.Flush();
p.Close();
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that the only difference between the two is that I'm adding the fixed document to a fixed document sequence, which then gets written.  </p>

<p>Obviously, whatever magic happens that causes the databinding to be evaluated and the bound values be inserted isn't happening when my fixed documents aren't being Written to the Xps Document.  I need to be able to write more than one fixed document, and the Write method can only be called once, thus requiring I add the FixedDocuments to a FixedDocumentSequence which I then write.  But I <em>also</em> need my damn databinding to work as well!  </p>

<p>Any help in this situation would be appreciated.  I know its not exactly the most common part of the framework; I'm just hoping that someone here has some operational experience with this (I'm looking at you, lurking MS employee).</p>

Every day I find myself copying folders of source code between my two desktop machines and the server, and such a utility is critical to avoid overwriting newer files with older ones and also to save time by only copying changed files.  In addition, the utility allows me to see new files in the source folder that I don't necessarily want to copy (like temp files) that I instead can delete.</p>

<p>Like anyone who subscribes to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NIH</a> way of thinking, I wrote my own utility to compare the contents of two folders and let me mark files to be copied, deleted, diffed or ignored.  I've had many versions of this utility going back to DOS, OS/2 and Win32.</p>

<p>I use this utility on a daily basis, and it leaves me wondering: What do others use?  Surely there are similar programs out there to do this...  My utility doesn't have a diff screen, and it would be occasionally nice to see what the difference is between two changed files.</p>

<p>I have a SQL Server 2005 database that has this exact procedure, and I'm trying to make the scripts to convert a test database to match this dev database.  My script has several lines like:</p>

<pre><code>CAST(RELATIVE_ERROR_RATIO AS FLOAT),
CAST(REPORTING_LIMIT AS FLOAT),
</code></pre>

<p>The procedure is essentially doing an ""insert into table (all the fields) from another table where field = @input""</p>

<p>When I run the script, I get the error:</p>

<pre><code>CAST or CONVERT: invalid attributes specified for type 'float'
</code></pre>

<p>and the procedure is not created.  But, I've compared the source tables in both the dev and test environments, and they match exactly.  And the procedure exists exactly as scripted in the dev environment. </p>

<p>I can't ask my co-worker if he had to do any special acrobatics to create this script, so I'm asking you.  I've done some searching, and see that perhaps float should be of the form FLOAT(6,1) (or some such), but that's NOT what he has, and I'm not comfortable changing the test environment so that it won't really match dev.</p>

<p>The commenter is correct.  I've been told that the error is with the following cast: </p>

<pre><code>CAST(TRACER_YIELD AS FLOAT(10,3)),

<p>I could post the entire query, but it's a long one!  So, instead, I'll just include the casted fields, and the first and last field.  I'd like to ask my co-worker if that one field was a mistake, and it just needed a straight cast.  He'll be back next monday, so it may need to wait that long.</p>

<li>Javascript to handle the UI (complain if invalid email address, say thanks when they hit enter, etc).</li>

<p>Or if there's a fancy Rails or AJAX way to do this, I'm very open to that, too.</p>

<p>(All I know currently is how to do this the old-school CGI way, with a plain html web form with a submit button and a server-side script that takes the form contents, pulls out the email address, and spits out html (potentially a redirect back to the original page).)</p>

<p>If I'm naive in thinking I can grab something off the shelf for this and should be starting with something like an AJAX tutorial, let me know that as well.

He gave me a baffled look and asked when anyone would ever need to do such a thing.</p>

<p>Off the top of my head I didn't have a good answer for him, other than ""hey, I need to do it right now"".  So I sat down and came up with a list of some of the things I've actually done with reflection in various languages.  Unfortunately, most of my examples come from my web programming in Python, and I was hoping that the people here would have more examples.  Here's the list I came up with:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Given a config file with lines like<br>
x = ""Hello World!""<br>
y = 5.0<br>
dynamically set the fields of some <code>config</code> object equal to the values in that file.  (This was what I wished I could do in C++, but actually couldn't do.)</p></li>
<li><p>When sorting a list of objects, sort based on an arbitrary attribute given that attribute's name from a config file or web request.</p></li>
<li><p>When writing software that uses a network protocol, reflection lets you call methods based on string values from that protocol.  For example, I wrote an IRC bot that would translate<br>
<code>!some_command arg1 arg2</code><br>
into a method call <code>actions.some_command(arg1, arg2)</code> and print whatever that function returned back to the IRC channel.</p></li>
<li><p>When using Python's __getattr__ function (which is sort of like method_missing in Ruby/Smalltalk) I was working with a class with a whole lot of statistics, such as late_total.  For every statistic, I wanted to be able to add _percent to get that statistic as a percentage of the total things I was counting (for example, stats.late_total_percent).  Reflection made this very easy.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So can anyone here give any examples from their own programming experiences of times when reflection has been helpful?  The next time a co-worker asks me why I'd ""ever want to do something like that"" I'd like to be more prepared.</p>

<p>To 'steer' it, you need to alter the force applied the left and right ""wheels"".  Eg.  1 unit of force on both wheels makes it go forward.  -1 units of force on both wheels makes it go backwards.  Apply more force to one wheel than the other and it turns.</p>

<p>How would you calculate the amount of force needed on both wheels to turn the tank a certain number of degrees either way?</p>

<p>Or am I thinking about this in the wrong way?</p>

As William Keller mentioned I missed out the speed of the tank.  Assume 1 unit of force on both wheels moves the tank forward at 1 unit per second.</p>

<p>1) building a list of SomeBean objects based on the results of a database call</p>

<p>2) putting that list in my command object</p>

<p>3) building a form based on that command object where users can modify attributes of the SomeBeans</p>

<p>4) extracting data out of the post-submit command object and writing the updated data to my database</p>

<p>My code looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class UpdateThingsinListController extends SimpleFormController {

    protected Object formBackingObject(final HttpServletRequest request)
          throws Exception {

    List&lt;SomeBean&gt; beans = database.getBeans();

    Command comamnd = new UpdateThingsCommand()
    command.setList(beans);

    return command;

  }

   protected ModelAndView onSubmit(final HttpServletRequest request,
          final HttpServletResponse response, final Object commandArg,
          final BindException errors) throws Exception {

    database.setBeans(commandArg.getList());        

   }


}
</code></pre>

<p>my jsp looks somthething like: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;form:form&gt;
    &lt;c:forEach var=""bean"" items=""${beans}"" varStatus=""status""&gt;
        &lt;form:checkbox path=""beans[${status.index}].someBooleanProperty"" /&gt;${bean.name} &lt;br&gt;    
    &lt;/c:forEach&gt;
&lt;/form:form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The code works fine, but it's just dawned on me that my ""beans"" list is getting created twice (sessionform must be false in my case) -- once when displaying the form, once when binding. If anything changes on the second creation (a bean is missing, the results are in a different order), my binding will get messed up, and I'll get fired. I'm beginning to think that any biding scheme where a command object needs to be merged with a form submission is very risky.</p>

<p>So, my question is -- how do folks ensure that form submissions get bound to lists correctly? Is there another way to do it besides list index? Object ids maybe? </p>

<p>thanks,</p>

In saying that, I don't mind using something third party if it can be bundled in with the tool, as long as it's not huge, and doesn't introduce any interactive steps. Ideally something in the windows API would be best, however I can't seem to track down anything relevant.</p>

  <p>Clarification: this is not about <em>user agent</em> calls to pages, but Classic ASP calling ASP.NET!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have applications that are midway through a transition from Classic ASP to ASP.NET. There are a half million lines of code, so a complete rewrite of everything at once was simply not plausible, or frankly prudent considering that the vast majority of Classic ASP pages work just fine. We translate pages and functionality as they come up for revision <em>anyway</em>, not just because it is ""cool"".</p>

<p>Now that about half the pages have been converted we have moved some of the key functionality over to ASP.NET. Instead of keeping the legacy versions of this functionality (which means two places to maintain instead of one) I have been moving towards using SOAP to expose this functionality.</p>

<p>Well... not really. Instead, we have been using what I used to call ""Poor Man's SOAP"", although today it is trendy to call it REST. I have been using ServerXMLHTTP to contact the destination page, bundling up a ball of XML and POSTing it over to the ASP.NET side. For the result I have been bundling up some XML and using XPATH to tear it down into variables.</p>

<p>All of this works surprisingly well. However, I have been contemplating the built in ASP.NET SOAP features, which would seem to remove the need to custom write landing pages for my cross platform calls... but when I look at consuming SOAP from Classic ASP most suggest using the seemingly depreciated Soap Toolkit. </p>

<p>The question is; do any of you have experience with this kind of setup and if so are there any better ways to do it than custom REST pages or Soap Toolkit? I think being able to expose more of the ASP.NET functionality quicker would help with the migration, but I don't want to get myself mired in legacy technology like Soap Toolkit unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Our team normally consists of about 4 developers and 2 testers. The scrum master insists that every team member should contribute equally to the velocity calculation i.e. we should not distinguish between developers and testers when working out how much we can do in a sprint. The is correct according to Scrum, but here's the problem.</p>

<p>Despite suggestions to the contrary, testers never help with non-test tasks and developers never help with non-dev tasks, so we are not cross functional team members at all. Also, despite various suggestions, testers normally spend the first few days of each sprint waiting for something to test. </p>

<p>The end result is that typically we take on far more dev work than we actually have capacity for in the sprint. For example, the developers might contribute 20 days to the velocity calculation and the testers 10 days. If you add up the tasks after sprint planning though, dev tasks add up to 25 days and test tasks add up to 5 days.</p>

<p>What i'm wondering is where is the best place to determine if this slug is unique and then insert it because the slug field is a Unique Key Index.</p>

<p>Originally, i had a trigger on any insert (against the table) so when the data is entered, the slug is then determined. I had a function that checked for the number of records that contained the user's text (not the slug) and then generated the slug and added the record count + 1 to the end of the new slug.</p>

<p>eg.</p>

<p>5 records are found in the table with the same User generated content.
the slug for this now the slug-text with a 6 added to the end.</p>

<p>Flaws: if the user changes their text, the slug doesn't change.</p>

<pre><code>Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance().add_endRequest(yellowFade);

<p>Where yellowFade is defined as...</p>

<pre><code>function yellowFade() {
    window.setTimeout(""$('#' + hyperlinkUrlId).animate( { backgroundColor: 'white' }, 2000)"", 2000);
    window.clearTimeout();
}

<p>Now, rarely I've had it crash right at this point but typically it is later, so I'll continue...</p>

<p>I then click a button titled ""Generate"" that creates a URL loads the ASP.Net hyperlink with the text for the URL it created and then via javascript sets it's background color to the yellow color to fade from via this...</p>

<pre><code>$(""#"" + hyperlinkUrlId).css(""background-color"", ""#FBFF9C"");</code></pre>

<p>I initially had it setting the color in the code behind via this code...</p>

<pre><code>Url.BackColor = ColorTranslator.FromHtml(""#FBFF9C"");</code></pre>

<p>But then I thought maybe the back color was getting set to something the jquery color plug-in couldn't recognize, or since it was being set server side the plug-in couldn't access it's style or something but changing it still had no effect on fixing the bug.</p>

<p>Finally, generate changes the URL's back color from white to yellow then as I said most of the time it fades just fine but rarely it throws an error ""Invalid property value.""  </p>

<p>As far as I can tell my syntax is just the way it should be for using the color animations.  I feel like the fact that I'm using an updatepanel might be wreaking havoc here but I'm not sure.  </p>

<p>However, Krzysztof Cwalina says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>One of the biggest misconceptions about exceptions is that they are for “exceptional conditions.” The reality is that they are for communicating error conditions. From a framework design perspective, there is no such thing as an “exceptional condition”. Whether a condition is exceptional or not depends on the context of usage, --- but reusable libraries rarely know how they will be used. For example, OutOfMemoryException might be exceptional for a simple data entry application; it’s not so exceptional for applications doing their own memory management (e.g. SQL server). In other words, one man’s exceptional condition is another man’s chronic condition.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>He then also goes on to say that exceptions should be used for:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Usage errors</li>
<li>Program errors</li>
<li>System failures</li>
</ul>

<p>Considering Krzysztof Cwalina is the PM for the CLR team at MS I ask: What do you think of his statement? </p>

One booking can contain several stays (a stay is a link between a room, the services ordered, etc.). Each stay has it's own time period, so you can create 3 stays in the same booking, for 3 different weeks.</p>

<p>My problem arises when bookings need to be changed. The input is the booking id (as seen above) as well as the new data on the wanted stays. So if the original stays were 2 single rooms and 1 double room, each with their own start and end date, and the customer wished to change one of the single rooms to a double room, he would send: 1 single, 2 double, and it's up to me to figure out what has changed (this is not going to change, so I'm afraid any solutions suggesting to change this is out).</p>

<p>I use LINQ to pick out the current stays and set them for deletion</p>

<pre><code>var oldStays = (from stay in persistentStorage.DataContext.Stays 
                where stays.booking_id == bookingId 
                select stay);
persistentStorage.DataContext.Stays.DeleteAllOnSubmit(oldStays);
</code></pre>

<p>Before I can delete them, however, I need to make sure that there is available rooms for the new stays. An easy way out would be if LINQ automatically assumes these records as deleted when making new queries (meaning I would not have to worry about dates, existing rooms, etc.). If that is the case, the problem is already solved.</p>

<p>If not, I need some way of checking for new available reservations while at the same time ignoring stays that have not changed (in the above case, I would only need to check if a double room was available in the given period, since the other double and single are already booked). Is there some smart way LINQ can assist in this, and if so, how?</p>

I'm sure it is, but what settings are needed so that the label and form will grow vertically? I've got my label set to <code>Anchor = top, left, right, bottom</code>, so I'd have thought that when text with newlines is set in the label the height of the label will increase, and since <code>Anchor = top &amp; bottom</code> it will force the form to increase in height. This doesn't seem to happen. What am I missing?</p>

This is for a security audit. We want to dump all of this information out in a readible fashion to make it easy to compare. My problem is that there is a bridge/link table for the permissions so there are multiple records per user. I want to get back results with all the permission for one user on one line. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>Table_User:
UserId   UserName
1        John
2        Joe
3        James

Table_UserPermissions:
UserId   PermissionId   Rights
1        10             1
1        11             2
1        12             3
2        11             2
2        12             3
3        10             2
</code></pre>

<p>PermissionID links to a table with the name of the Permission and what it does. Right is like 1 = view, 2 = modify, and etc. </p>

<p>What I get back from a basic query for User 1 is:</p>

<pre><code>UserId UserName PermissionId Rights
1      John     10           1
1      John     11           2
1      John     12           3
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like something like this:</p>

<pre><code>UserId UserName Permission1 Rights1 Permission2 Right2 Permission3 Right3
1      John     10          1       11          2      12          3
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally I would like this for all users.
The closest thing I've found is the Pivot function in SQL Server 2005.

The problem with this from what I can tell is that I need to name each column for each user and I'm not sure how to get the rights level. With real data I have about 130 users and 40 different permissions. </p>

<p>Is there another way with just sql that I can do this? </p>

<li>Two triangles (A, B, C) and (B, C, D), who share edge BC</li>
</ul>

<p>I am using this method for collision detection:</p>

<pre><code>For each Triangle
    If the original point is in front of the current triangle, and the desired point is behind the desired triangle:
        Calculate the intersection point of the ray (original-desired) and the plane (triangle's normal).
        If the intersection point is inside the triangle edges (!)
            Respond to the collision.

Next Triangle

<p>The problem I am having is that sometimes the point falls into the grey area of floating point math where it is so close to the line BC that it fails to collide with either triangle, even though technically it should always collide with one or the other since they share an edge.  When this happens the point passes right between the two edge sharing triangles.  I have marked one line of the code with <strong>(!)</strong> because I believe that's where I should be making a change.</p>

<p>One idea that works in very limited situations is to skip the edge testing.  Effectively turning the triangles into planes.  This only works when my meshes are convex hulls, but I plan to create convex shapes.</p>

<p>I am specifically using the dot product and triangle normals for all of my front-back testing.</p>

My solution was to basically extract the text box's value out of the <code>Request.Form</code> object:   <code>Request.Form[myTextBox.UniqueID]</code>, which does contain the user-supplied value.</p>

<p>What could be going on, here?<br>
As I mentioned, the other text boxes receive the user-supplied values just fine, and this particular problematic text box doesn't have any logic associated to it -- it just takes the value and saves it.<br>
The main difference between this text box and the others is that this is a multi-line box (for inputting notes), which I believe is rendered as an HTML ""textarea"" tag instead of an ""input"" tag in ASP.NET.</p>

The settings class has a collection of objects that do things periodically, and then there's something of interest, they need to alert the main form and have it update.</p>

<p>I'm currently doing this through Events on the objects, and when each object is created, I add an EventHandler to maps the event back to the form. However, I'm running into some trouble that suggests that these requests aren't always ending up on the main copy of my form. For example, my form has a notification tray icon, but when the form captures and event and attempts to display a bubble, no bubble appears. However, if I modify that code to make the icon visible (though it already is), and then display the bubble, a second icon appears and displays the bubble properly.</p>

<p>Has anybody run into this before? Is there a way that I can force all of my events to be captured by the single instance of the form, or is there a completely different way to handle this? I can post code samples if necessary, but I'm thinking it's a common threading problem.</p>

<p><strong>MORE INFORMATION:</strong> I'm currently using Me.InvokeRequired in the event handler on my form, and it always returns FALSE in this case. Also, the second tray icon created when I make it visible from this form doesn't have a context menu on it, whereas the ""real"" icon does - does that clue anybody in?</p>

<p>I'm going to pull my hair out! This can't be that hard!</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong>: Thanks to nobugz for the clue, and it lead me to the code I'm now using (which works beautifully, though I can't help thinking there's a better way to do this). I added a private boolean variable to the form called ""IsPrimary"", and added the following code to the form constructor:</p>

<pre><code>    Public Sub New()
        If My.Application.OpenForms(0).Equals(Me) Then
            Me.IsFirstForm = True
        End If
    End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Once this variable is set and the constructor finishes, it heads right to the event handler, and I deal with it this way (CAVEAT: Since the form I'm looking for is the primary form for the application, My.Application.OpenForms(0) gets what I need. If I was looking for the first instance of a non-startup form, I'd have to iterate through until I found it):</p>

<pre><code>    Public Sub EventHandler()
        If Not IsFirstForm Then
            Dim f As Form1 = My.Application.OpenForms(0)
            f.EventHandler()
            Me.Close()
        ElseIf InvokeRequired Then
            Me.Invoke(New HandlerDelegate(AddressOf EventHandler))
        Else
            ' Do your event handling code '
        End If
    End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>First, it checks to see if it's running on the correct form - if it's not, then call the right form. Then it checks to see if the thread is correct, and calls the UI thread if it's not. Then it runs the event code. I don't like that it's potentially three calls, but I can't think of another way to do it. It seems to work well, though it's a little cumbersome. If anybody has a better way to do it, I'd love to hear it!</p>

<p>Again, thanks for all the help - this was going to drive me nuts!</p>

I'm attempting to figure out the best way to get our firewalls configured, but I'm at a loss. By watching the NetMon trace, it appears as though it's ignoring what I tell it; the HTTP headers I see go out from the request (not the browser-to-my-server request, but the my-server-to-remote-server request) don't add up.</p>

<pre><code>Http: Request, CONNECT some.random.url:443

<p>The TCP DstPort also seems to always start with HTTP(80). I can't seem to get it to handle 443 initially, no matter what; does SSL start out with a port 80 negotiate before it begins ""real"" transmission? To boot, this request seems to ignore any HttpWebRequest settings I try to set before initiating the request: even if I set HTTP 1.0, or keep-alive to false, it still starts off with the above headers.</p>

<p>What's it doing? I'd like to know how to let it through, but I'm not sure why it's exhibiting that behavior?</p>

<p>Code below, if it helps.</p>

      &lt;redirect view-id=""/customer/presences.xhtml"" /&gt;
    &lt;/rule&gt;
  &lt;/navigation&gt;
&lt;/page&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My bean starts like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Name(""presenceHome"")
@Scope(ScopeType.CONVERSATION)
public class PresenceHome extends EntityHome&lt;Presence&gt; implements Serializable {
  @In
  private CustomerDao customerDao;

  @In(required = false)
  private Long presenceId;

  @In(required = false)
  private Long customerId;

  private Customer customer;

  // Getters, setters and other methods follow. They return the correct types defined above
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally the link I use to link one one page to the next looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;s:link styleClass=""#{selected == 'presences' ? 'selected' : ''}""
    view=""/customer/presences.xhtml"" title=""Presences"" propagation=""none""&gt;
    &lt;f:param name=""customerId"" value=""#{customerId}"" /&gt;
    Presences
&lt;/s:link&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>All this seems to work fine.  When I hover over the link above in my page, I get a URL ending in something like ""?customerId=123"".  So the parameter is being passed over and it's something that can be easily converted into a Long type.  But for some reason, it's not.  I've done similar things to this before in other projects and it's worked then.  I just can't see what it isn't working now.</p>

<p>If I remove the  element from my page declaration, I get through to the page fine.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a C++ library for Windows (XP and Vista preferably) that will let me use a finite number of threads, one dedicated to each piece of the networking problem. As an example, I want to use a thread to report the positional information of the player to the server (and to receive responses about positional information of the other players) but I want a different thread to background download in the 3D artwork for the area/players, and a different thread for the built in chat system, etc. These all need to be fairly independent of one another.</p>

<p>I know what I want to <em>do</em> with the library, I've got the design bit figured out, I just feel a bit silly re-inventing the wheel, since I know that a good library for this exact purpose probably already exists. So, what are your suggestions? I need to be able to send data to a server, and accept responses. Ideally, the request needs to trigger an Event when its done (so I can immediately grab the data and do something with it) and I need to be able to handle multiple transactions simultaneously. HTTP is a nice bonus, but I can handle HTTP protocol myself if necessary, especially considering that I plan on dropping it in the long run.</p>

We then include the .d file for each .cc file using an include $(CXXFILES:.cc=.d) line.  But when we delete file or move files, the dependancies step breaks and we have to manually delete the .d files (even a make clean doesn't work because the dependencies fail)</p>

<p>Is there a way to generate these dependency .d files or include these dependency .d files which will gracefully handle a file deletion or relocation?</p>

<p>EDIT: For example: I have serial.cc and the makefiles generate a serial.d file which has a dependency on buffer.h but then I change it so I don't need buffer.h any more and I delete buffer.h.  Next time I run make, it will choke because it includes the .d file which still makes serial.o depend on buffer.h.</p>

<p>My initial instinct would be no, under the assumption that the same instance of the EJB would service multiple requests at the same time.

<pre><code>VoidFunction t = delegate { int i = 0; };

int i = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>It says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A local variable named 'i' cannot be
  declared in this scope because it
  would give a different meaning to 'i',
  which is already used in a 'child'
  scope to denote something else</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this basically means that variables declared inside a delegate will have the scope of the function declared in. Not exactly what I would have expected. I havn't even tried to call the function. At least Common Lisp has a feature where you say that a variable should have a dynamic name, if you really want it to be local. This is particularly important when creating macros that do not leak, but something like that would be helpful here as well.</p>

<p>So I'm wondering what other people do to work around this issue?</p>

<p>To clarify I'm looking for a solution where the variables I declare in the delegete doesn't interfere with variables declared <em>after</em> the delegate. And I want to still be able to capture variables declared before the delegate.</p>

Description:
    The 'rails new' command creates a new Rails application with a default
    directory structure and configuration at the path you specify.

    You can specify extra command-line arguments to be used every time
    'rails new' runs in the .railsrc configuration file in your home directory.

    Note that the arguments specified in the .railsrc file don't affect the
    defaults values shown above in this help message.

Example:
    rails new ~/Code/Ruby/weblog

    This generates a skeletal Rails installation in ~/Code/Ruby/weblog.
    See the README in the newly created application to get going.

<pre><code>pictures = gallery.picture_set.annotate( score=models.Sum( 'picturevote__value' ) ).order_by( '-score' )

<p>There is a table of galleries. In each of them are some pictures. When a user votes up or down a picture, a new row in 'picturevote' is inserted and connected to the picture. Then I can get the total score for the pictures.
Now I want to order the pictures of one gallery by their score values. But due to the table joins there can be the value NULL for score when there were no votes at all. Nevertheless a score of 'NULL' shall be treated as '0'.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>edit:
Okay, here some additional explanation:
The problem is that the aggregation in the above example sets <code>score</code> to NULL. When I want to display the score I use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>score = self.picturevote_set.aggregate( models.Sum( 'value' ) )[ 'value__sum' ] or 0
</code></pre>

<p>Then the aggregation leads either to NULL (if there are no picturevote rows) or a certain value. If it is NULL the or-expression converts it to a displayable integer value.
But this solves just the display problems which are caused by the NULL value.
When I want to sort the pictures by this <code>score</code> value as in the first code example all entries with NULL are put at the end of the ordered result set. First there are pictures with positive scores, then there are the pictures with negative values and THEN there are the pictures that were not voted up or down so far, because they have NULL as <code>score</code>.</p>

<p>My question is how this behaviour can be changed so that the order is correct.</p>

The logic behind that is that if you are generating code with a generator then there is a better more efficient way to build the code through generics and templating. </p>

<p>While I slightly agree with this statement above, I have not really found effective ways to build templates that can say for instance instantiate themselves. In otherwords I can never do :</p>

<pre><code>return new T();

<p>Additionally, if I want to generate code based on database values I have found that using <code>Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.SMO</code> in conjunction with T4 templates have been wonderful at generating mass amounts of code without having to copy / paste or use resharper.</p>

<p>Many of the problems I have found with Generics too is that to my shock there are a lot of developers who do not understand them. When I do examine generics for a solution, there are times where it gets complicated because C# states that you cannot do something that may seem logical in my mind.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts? Do you prefer to build a generator, or do you prefer to use generics? Also, how far can generics go? I know a decent amount about generics, but there are traps and pitfalls that I always run into that cause me to resort to a T4 template.</p>

dear all;</p>

<p>i know my problem took alot of time and many of u helped me but i'm new in C# and this is my first application..</p>

<p>now i read an article:</p>

<p>C# Signature:</p>

<pre><code>  [DllImport(""coredll.dll"", SetLastError=true, CharSet=CharSet.Auto)]
  [return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.Bool)]
  static extern bool GetDiskFreeSpaceEx(string lpDirectoryName,
                                        out ulong lpFreeBytesAvailable,
                                        out ulong lpTotalNumberOfBytes,
                                        out ulong lpTotalNumberOfFreeBytes);
</code></pre>

<p>Sample Code:</p>

<pre><code>   ulong FreeBytesAvailable;
   ulong TotalNumberOfBytes;
   ulong TotalNumberOfFreeBytes;

   bool success = GetDiskFreeSpaceEx(""C:\\"", out FreeBytesAvailable, out  
                                    TotalNumberOfBytes,out TotalNumberOfFreeBytes);
   if (!success)
         throw new System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception();

   Console.WriteLine(""Free Bytes Available:      {0,15:D}"", FreeBytesAvailable);
   Console.WriteLine(""Total Number Of Bytes:     {0,15:D}"", TotalNumberOfBytes);
   Console.WriteLine(""Total Number Of FreeBytes: {0,15:D}"", TotalNumberOfFreeBytes);
</code></pre>

<p>now how to use this function GetDiskFreeSpaceEx , and should i add C# signature to somewhere ?!? and what about the coredll.dll ?!?</p>

<p>my code is like that :</p>

<pre><code>  FolderInfo = (CONADefinitions.CONAPI_FOLDER_INFO)Marshal.PtrToStructure(Buffer,     
                                      typeof(CONADefinitions.CONAPI_FOLDER_INFO));
  if (FolderInfo.pstrName[0].ToString() != ""C"" &amp;&amp; level == 0) 
  {
      // here i want to get the Total Size of the currentDirectory and freeSize
      // i want them in Bytes
  }
</code></pre>

<p>i searched on google but i dont have enough exprience to know the right tag</p>

<p>thnx</p>

<p>To sum it up for those who don't want to read the entire post. The author implements a higher order function named Curry like this (refactored by me without his internal class):</p>

<pre><code> public static Func&lt;T1, Func&lt;T2, TResult&gt;&gt; 
             Curry&lt;T1, T2, TResult&gt;(this Func&lt;T1, T2, TResult&gt; fn)
 {
     Func&lt;Func&lt;T1, T2, TResult&gt;, Func&lt;T1, Func&lt;T2, TResult&gt;&gt;&gt; curry = 
     f =&gt; x =&gt; y =&gt; f(x, y);
     return curry(fn);
 }
</code></pre>

<p>That gives us the ability to take an expression like F(x, y) 
eg. </p>

<pre><code>Func&lt;int, int, int&gt; add = (x, y) =&gt; x + y;
</code></pre>

<p>and call it in the F.Curry()(x)(y) manner;</p>

<p>This part i understood and i find it cool in a geeky way. What i fail to wrap my head around is the practical usecases for this approach. When and where this technique is necessary and what can be gained from it?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Edited:
 After the initial 3 responses i understand that the gain would be that in some cases when we create a new function from the curried some parameters are not re evalued.
I made this little test in C# (keep in mind that i'm only interested in the C# implementation and not the curry theory in general):</p>

<pre><code>public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Func&lt;Int, Int, string&gt; concat = (a, b) =&gt; a.ToString() + b.ToString();
    Func&lt;Int, Func&lt;Int, string&gt;&gt; concatCurry = concat.Curry();
    Func&lt;Int, string&gt; curryConcatWith100 = (a) =&gt; concatCurry(100)(a);

    Console.WriteLine(curryConcatWith100(509));
    Console.WriteLine(curryConcatWith100(609));
}

    public struct Int
    {
        public int Value {get; set;}

        public override string ToString()
        {
             return Value.ToString();
        }

        public static implicit operator Int(int value)
        {
            return new Int { Value = value };
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>On the 2 consecutive calls to curryConcatWith100 the ToString() evaluation for the value 100 is called twice (once for each call) so i dont see any gain in evaluation here. Am i missing something ?</p>

It picks least recently used page frame and wants to swap its contents out to the disk and allocate that frame to another process. </p>

<p>What bothers me is that this page frame was already mapped to, generally speaking, several (identical) pages of several processes. The kernel has to somehow find all of those processes and mark the page as swapped out. How does it carry that out?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>EDIT: Illustrations to the question:</p>

<p>Before the swapping processes 1 and 2 had a shared Page 1, which resided in the physical memory frame 1:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NSCWF.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now, the memory in the system is exhausted and kernel allocates memory for  process 3 by swapping out Page 1 from frame 1 and replacing it with Page 2.
In order to do that, it has to </p>

<p>1) find all the processes, referring to Page 1 (Process 1 and Process 2 in our case)</p>

<p>2) modify their Page Table Entries, setting ""Present"" bit to 0 and setting the Page 1 location in Swap</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SqR01.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So, I don't get, how the step 1 is carried out. Kernel couldn't be just iteratively looking into every process's Page Tables in order to find the Page Table Entry, pointing to frame 1. There should be some kind of reverse mapping from page frames to Page Table Entries.</p>

<p>THE ANSWER IS:</p>

<p>""The most significant and important change to page table management is the introduction of Reverse Mapping (rmap). Referring to it as “rmap” is deliberate as it is the common usage of the “acronym” and should not be confused with the -rmap tree developed by Rik van Riel which has many more alterations to the stock VM than just the reverse mapping.</p>

<p>In a single sentence, rmap grants the ability to locate all PTEs which map a particular page given just the struct page. In 2.4, the only way to find all PTEs which map a shared page, such as a memory mapped shared library, is to linearaly search all page tables belonging to all processes. This is far too expensive and Linux tries to avoid the problem by using the swap cache (see Section 11.4). This means that with many shared pages, Linux may have to swap out entire processes regardless of the page age and usage patterns. 2.6 instead has a PTE chain associated with every struct page which may be traversed to remove a page from all page tables that reference it. This way, pages in the LRU can be swapped out in an intelligent manner without resorting to swapping entire processes.""</p>

<p>Some ways I know, all of which seem quite backwards:</p>

<ol>
<li>Given the full path, search for each folder on the path (via FindFirstFile). This gives proper cased results of each folder. At the last step, search for the file itself.</li>
<li>Get filename from handle (as in <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366789(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">MSDN example</a>).

</code></pre>

<p>And then in the Global.asax file:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Application_EndRequest(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    EntityContext.RemoveContext();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is that if this is being run with a web application, the context is created on first need (and saved to the current HttpContext) and torn down whenever the request is over.</p>

<p>If this is a UnitTest situation it is against created on first need and removed in the TestCleanup (Not as important in this post but just wanted to clarify the _context object).</p>

<p>Now the idea behind this is in the least to not have to do this:</p>

<pre><code>using(TISQLEntities context = new TISQLEntities())
{
  ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>Everytime I want to query.  I realize this may be me being lazy, but I just think that it's easier and cleaner to have:</p>

<pre><code>EntityContext.Context.User.Select(...)
</code></pre>

<p>And avoids ""using"" which I try to avoid for most cases.  On top of that, I'm not creating 9001 contexts per postback.</p>

<p>Now what I am curious about is that am I over thinking this?  Should I just keep creating a context for every method that needs one?  Say on a post back I have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get the user from an ID</li>
<li>Get a site from an id</li>
<li>Add the Site to the User (user.Site = foundSite)</li>
<li>Save the user</li>
</ul>

<p>That could entail at least 3 contexts.  Is entity framework smart enough that it's ok to just keep creating contexts whenever?</p>

<p>I am trying to check directory write-permissions from within a Windows MFC/ATL program using C++. My first guess is to use the C-standard _access function, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>if (_access(""C:\mydir"", 2) == -1)

<p>But apparently on Windows 2000 and XP, _access can't determine directory permissions. (i.e. the Security tab in the Properties dialog when you right-click on a directory in Explorer) So, is there an elegant way to determine a directory's write-permissions in Windows 2000/XP using any of the Windows C++ libraries? If so, how?</p>

<p>Google results seem to suggest that perhaps the solution is that I need to impersonate user account that exists on the server machine.   --I have also stumbled across this codeproject article which demonstrates user impersonation.

<p>I know that the object could be designed so that the logger object dependency could be injected and hence mocked in a unit test, but that's not always the case - in more complicated scenarios, you do need to compose other objects or make calls to static methods.</p>

<p>As we don't want to test the logger object, only the myObj, how do we proceed?  Do we create a stubbed ""double"" with the test script?  Something like:</p>

<pre><code>class logger
{
    public function __construct($filepath) {}
    public function info($message) {}
}

class TestMyObj extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase 
{
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This seems feasible for small objects but would be a pain for more complicated APIs where the SUT depended on the return values.  Also, what if you want to test the calls to the dependency object in the same was you can with mock objects?  Is there a way of mocking objects which are instantiated by the SUT rather than being passed in?</p>

<p>I've read the man page on mocks but it doesn't seem to cover this situation where the dependency is composed rather than aggregated.  How do you do it?</p>

<p>After I create all of the templates and add them to the DataGrid, I bind the data to the DataGrid.  The correct data shows up.  My problem is that I don't get notification of when the checkbox is checked.</p>

<p>If I add </p>

<p>Click=""CheckBox_Checked"", </p>

<p>This all works fine but no column names are displayed.  So I then modify the SetupColumnStructure method so that the HeaderText is set on the template field like this...</p>

<pre><code>private void SetupColumnStructure(IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; columnNames)
{
    var columnNumber = 0;
    foreach (var columnName in columnNames)
    {
        var templateColumn = new TemplateField
                                 {
                                     ItemTemplate = new CellTemplate(columnName),
                                     HeaderText = columnName
                                };
       grdResults.Columns.Insert(columnNumber, templateColumn);
       columnNumber++;
    }
}

<p>For some reason this one extra line change causes the row.FindControl(""hypEdit""); call in the OnRowDataBound handler to return null.Can anyone see something im missing here or has anyone experienced a similar issue?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I've made sure that I'm not referring to a header or footer row here. Also, if I step over the object reference exception this occurs for every item that is in the DataSource.</p>

<p>Not sure if this helps, but as I expected, when I stepped through the code the table has generated all the columns expected but all cells (DataControlFieldCells) contain no controls when the HeaderText is set, yet all expected controls when it isnt set.</p>

<p>All very strange. Let me know if you can spot anything else.</p>

<p>The dimension is hierarchical using 4 columns from a single table (the entire cube uses a single table).</p>

<p>The error message received (regardless if I process the entire cube or the dimension, whether I ""Process full"" or not) is this:</p>

<p>My guess is that this is related to the amount of growing data (currently 15 million rows in the specific table).</p>

<ul>
<li>It has worked before (no changes has been made)</li>
<li>The processing reads 11 million rows before displaying the error</li>
<li>Physical memory on the server runs out at the time the error is displayed</li>
<li>Googling the error message results in a few hits indicating column size as a problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Could anyone point me in the right direction? I guess that one way out could be to try using smaller columns (varchar(x) instead of varchar(y)) but it feels like going around the problem instead of solving the issue.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an example of polymorphism in
  action, let's look at the classic
  ""eval"" interview question, which (as
  far as I know) was brought to Amazon
  by Ron Braunstein. The question is
  quite a rich one, as it manages to
  probe a wide variety of important
  skills: OOP design, recursion, binary
  trees, polymorphism and runtime
  typing, general coding skills, and (if
  you want to make it extra hard)
  parsing theory.</p>
  
  <p>At some point, the candidate hopefully
  realizes that you can represent an
  arithmetic expression as a binary
  tree, assuming you're only using
  binary operators such as ""+"", ""-"",
  ""*"", ""/"". The leaf nodes are all
  numbers, and the internal nodes are
  all operators. Evaluating the
  expression means walking the tree. If
  the candidate doesn't realize this,
  you can gently lead them to it, or if
  necessary, just tell them.</p>
  
  <p>Even if you tell them, it's still an
  interesting problem.</p>
  
  <p>The first half of the question, which
  some people (whose names I will
  protect to my dying breath, but their
  initials are Willie Lewis) feel is a
  Job Requirement If You Want To Call
  Yourself A Developer And Work At
  Amazon, is actually kinda hard. The
  question is: how do you go from an
  arithmetic expression (e.g. in a
  string) such as ""2 + (2)"" to an
  expression tree. We may have an ADJ
  challenge on this question at some
  point.</p>
  
  <p>The second half is: let's say this is
  a 2-person project, and your partner,
  who we'll call ""Willie"", is
  responsible for transforming the
  string expression into a tree. You get
  the easy part: you need to decide what
  classes Willie is to construct the
  tree with. You can do it in any
  language, but make sure you pick one,
  or Willie will hand you assembly
  language. If he's feeling ornery, it
  will be for a processor that is no
  longer manufactured in production.</p>
  
  <p>You'd be amazed at how many candidates
  boff this one.</p>
  
  <p>I won't give away the answer, but a
  Standard Bad Solution involves the use
  of a switch or case statment (or just
  good old-fashioned cascaded-ifs). A
  Slightly Better Solution involves
  using a table of function pointers,
  and the Probably Best Solution
  involves using polymorphism. I
  encourage you to work through it
  sometime. Fun stuff!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, let's try to tackle the problem all three ways.  How do you go from an arithmetic expression (e.g. in a string) such as ""2 + (2)"" to an expression tree using cascaded-if's, a table of function pointers, and/or polymorphism?  </p>

<p>Feel free to tackle one, two, or all three.</p>

<pre><code>var b:Button = _level0.instance4.submitBtn;
</code></pre>

<p>I was hoping there was an instance-retrieval method for AS2 similar to AS3's <code>MovieClip.getChildByName()</code> or even Javascript's <code>document.getElementById()</code>.  Because hard-coding the names of these anonymous instances (like <code>instance4</code> in the above) just feel really, really dirty.</p>

<p>But, I can't find anything of the sort at <a href=""http://flash-reference.icod.de/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this AS2 Reference</a>.</p>

<p>With Rails 2.3 out, I'd like an update on the situation. Specifics questions I have in mind are:</p>

<ul>
<li>first off, is it good to go?</li>
<li>table naming, what rule to follow?</li>
<li>associations, how to declare them with the least verbosity? how to name foreign key columns?</li>
<li>auto-requiring, does it work if you put the model files in a subdir matching the namespace? or, how to name and where to place the files?</li>
<li>generation, does the model generator handles namespaces successfully and correctly?</li>
<li>generation, how about the scaffold generator, which includes controllers?</li>
<li>any incompatibilities/quirkinesses one should be aware of?</li>

I wrote the code to do so in a for loop instead a method that was called when the user tapped a UIButton ( the button's action ). </p>

<p>Here's that loop:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; [Images count]; i++) {
    if( i &gt; 0 ){
        [self toggleImageViewOff:[Images objectAtIndex:i - 1]];
    }

    [self toggleImageViewOn:[Images objectAtIndex:i]];

    [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:0.5f];
}
</code></pre>

<p>The UI did not update as I expected as I only ever saw the last UIImageView in the ""on"" state. I figured that the drawing update of the views must occur in the main thread this code was also executing in. So I learned about performSelectorInBackground:withObject: . Performing the toggleImageViewOn/Off methods using this made the loop work. The problem is if I make the sleep interval too short I can have an ""on"" update after an ""off"" with Threads operating out of order. </p>

<p>So I had the bright idea of moving the whole loop with the sleep into its own method and calling that from the action method using performSelectorInBackground:withObject: . I tried that and I'm back to not getting an updated view until the loop is over. </p>

<p>That's a long winded way to get to my question:</p>

<p>What's the best way to animate this to guarantee the on/off code fires in the right order and still get view updates, even at high speeds? ( i.e. looping very quickly ) </p>

<p>I tried to think about how I'd do it with CoreAnimation, but I can't seem to get my head around how to do it there. </p>

<p>For bonus, here are the toggle methods:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)toggleImageViewOn:(UIImageView *)theImageView {
    [theImageView setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@""on.png""]];
}

- (void)toggleImageViewOff:(UIImageView *)theImageView {
    [theImageView setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@""off.png""]];

Just to be clear, I'm not using CSSEdit to edit the file - rather the file is part of the CSSEdit package. I'm using TextMate to edit the file (although ""Property List Editor.app"" is another option) and it is in XML format. Here's a snippet from the AutoCompletion.plist file:</p>

<p>But, even code-behinds are confusing.  What event should show the success message?  onItemUpdate, right?  Fine, but then let's say you make another change and get a validation error?  Your success message stays.  I wasn't able to find an event that would reliably turn off an existing success message if there were a validation error.  </p>

<p>This should be web development 101!  Why is it so hard?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Someone suggested using the ItemCommand event... I tried this and many other events, but that success message just won't disappear.  Here's some code.</p>

<p>My message in ASP.NET</p>

<pre><code>&lt;label id=""successMessage"" class=""successMessage"" runat=""server""&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And my DataView tag (simplified):</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;asp:DetailsView 
        Id=""EditClient""
        DataKeyNames=""LicenseID"" 
    DataSourceID=""MySource""
    runat=""server"" 
        OnItemUpdated=""SuccessfulClientUpdate""
        OnItemCommand=""ClearMessages""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And, my code-behind:</p>

<pre><code>protected void SuccessfulClientUpdate(object sender, DetailsViewUpdatedEventArgs e)
{
    successMessage.InnerText = string.Format(""Your changes were saved."");
    successMessage.Visible = true;
}

protected void ClearMessages(object sender, DetailsViewCommandEventArgs e)
{
    successMessage.InnerText = string.Empty;
    successMessage.Visible = false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once I do a successful update, however, nothing seems to make that message disappear, not even failed validation.</p>

<p><strong>2nd EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Just want to be clear that I did try putting the ClearMessages code in Page_Load.  However, nothing seems to make that successMessage label disappear when I hit update a 2nd time WITH a validation error.  Can anyone suggest any other troubleshooting tips?</p>

To simplify what I'm doing, my code generates a chart. The chart consists of multiple parts (axises, labels, plot, legend, etc.) My code looks like:</p>

<pre><code>var Graph = function() {
  var private_data;
  function draw_legend() { ... }
  function draw_plot() { ... }

<p>Some people advocate only testing the public interface of your classes, which makes sense, but I'd really like to get in some tests to test each of the components separately.

<p>I could separate each of the components in different classes, for example make a Legend class. But it seems silly to create a class for what's sometimes just 5-10 lines of code, and it would be uglier because I'd need to pass in a bunch of private state. And I wouldn't be able to test my helper functions. Should I do this anyway? Should I suck it up and only test the public draw()? Or is there some other solution?</p>

<p>So i've been working a bit with it and it seemed fine, but now i start running into trouble with it - it simply won't parse certain stuff i encode with Newtonsoft's JSON .NET serializer. Ok so perhaps the .net seralizer messes up? Not how i see it - it produces a fine javascript string that looks like perfect json.</p>

<p>The problem comes when it has to encode a single quote ' and perhaps double quotes "".
Take a look at these examples (only parts of the full string)</p>

<pre><code>{""Id"":10651,""Text"":""\'69""}
{""Id"":184,""Text"":""13\""""}

<pre><code>var jsonObject = '[{""Id"":46,""Type"":2,.....................

<p>I'm thinking it has to escape the singlequote in the string to avoid conflicting with my wrapping of the string in single quotes, and escape the double quote to avoid conflicting with the json format?</p>

<p>So either i'm doing something wrong or the json2.js is not doing it right? Or yeah perhaps the .net json is messing up - i'm kinda thinking i'm messing it up, but i've been trying to do all sorts of stuff to help with the parsing like escaping/unescaping etc. before the serializing/deserializing.</p>

Thanks for the feedback. The reason i want to store more data in the cookie than the ID is because the object i really need takes about 2 seconds to retreive from a service i have no control over. I made a lightweight object 'KundeContext' to hold a few of the properties from the full object, but these are used 90% of the time. This way i only have to call the slow service on 10% of my pages. If i only stored the Id i would still have to call the service on almost all my pages.</p>

<p>I could store all the strings and ints seperately but the object has other lightweight objects like 'contactinformation' and 'address' that would be tedious to manually store for each of their properties.</p>

<p>The main reason for this is to get the GRID (not the columns inside the grid) to align fully to the size of the window.  I know, it makes a mockery of the horizontal resizer, but that's what I have to do!</p>

<p>FYI my set up is the following:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    $(""#flex1"").flexigrid
    (
    {
        url: '&lt;%= ResolveUrl(""~/Data.ashx"") %&gt;?filter=none',
        dataType: 'json',
        colModel: [
        { display: '', name: 'view', width: 20, sortable: true, align: 'center' },
        { display: 'Street', name: 'Street', width: 260, sortable: true, align: 'left' },
        { display: 'Town', name: 'Town', width: 200, sortable: true, align: 'left' },
        { display: '', name:'Actions', width:30, sortable: false, align: 'center' }
        ],

        width: 800,
        height: 200
    }
    );
});
</code></pre>

<p>but the following function doesn't work:</p>

<pre><code>function ResizeGrid() {
    $('#flex1').flexOptions({ width:1000 }).flexReload();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It causes the grid to refresh, but nothing more.</p>

Especially, there are data that is stored sometimes as integers and sometimes as strings, and I have to parse strings to integers reliably. If parsing goes wrong it should always return 0.</p>

<p>The problem is, I can't use any of the .NET/VB.NET parsing functions for this, but I have to rely on a self-made function. </p>

<p>Could I use a one-liner standard framework call to do every String-to-Integer parsing task?</p>

<p>Let's say there is a string that can be null, empty, contain an integer representation like ""10"" or contain something else.</p>

<p>I have tried these with an <strong>empty input string """"</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>CType(string, Integer) -&gt; Conversion from string """" to type 'Integer' is not valid.
Convert.ToInt32(string) -&gt; Input string was not in a correct format.
Integer.Parse(string) -&gt; Input string was not in a correct format.
CInt(string) -&gt; Conversion from string """" to type 'Integer' is not valid.
Val(string) -&gt; Success!

<p>But even Val can fail. The surefire way is to call a self-made function: </p>

<pre><code>   Public Function ToInteger(ByVal s As String) As Integer

        s = Trim(s)
        Dim i As Integer

        Try
            i = Val(s)
        Catch ex As Exception
            i = 0
        End Try

        Return i

    End Function

<p>I think this sucks. This is bad because:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm trying to parse strings to integers! This is not rocket science, even if semantics are involved</li>
<li>Self-made standards do not stick very well. Somewhere in the code you will always find broken standard framework solutions</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result there are unnecessary bugs in the software. And I accuse the standard framework for this. Unless, of course a better solution is found :)</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks for all the answers. Int32.TryParse is perfect here. </p>

<p><strong>Output</strong></p>

<pre><code>P = [selly_oak, edgbaston, ... , aston]

<pre><code>Route from selly_oak to aston
</code></pre>

<p>It would provide me with:</p>

<pre><code>Go from selly_oak to edgbaston
Go from edgbaston to ...
Finally, Go from ... to aston.
</code></pre>

<p>Prolog is a powerful language so I assume this is easily possible, however many of the books I've taken out seem to skip over this part. As far as I am aware I have to use something along the lines of write() and read() although the details are unknown to me.</p>

<p>Could anyone here a Prolog novice out with some basic examples or links to further information?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> A lot of these answers seem very complicated, where the solution should only be around 5-10 lines of code. Reading in a value isn't a problem as I can do something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>find:- 
    write('Where are you? '), 
    read(X), 
    nl, write('Where do you want to go? '),
    read(Y), 
    loopForRoute(X,Y).
</code></pre>

<p>I'd prefer it if the output could be written out using write() so a new line (nl) can be used, so that it displays like the output above.</p>

<p>If this were my input, how would I then arrange the top routeplan() to work with these inputs? Also, if I were to add the Lines for these stations as an extra parameter how would this then be implemented? All links are defined at the beginning of the file like so:</p>

<pre><code>rlinks(selly_oak, edgbaston, uob_line).
rlinks(edgbaston, bham_new_street, main_line).
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore, with this information, it'd be good to be able to read the line as so.</p>

<p>Web services have been around for a while, and for a while it seemed that the terms 'SOAP' and 'Web service' were largely interchangeable. However SOAP always seemed unwieldy and massively overcomplicated to me.</p>

<p>Then REST came along, and suddenly web services made sense.</p>

<p>As Joel Spolsky says, give a programmer a REST URL, and they can start playing with the service right away, figuring it out.</p>

<p>SOAP is obfuscated behind WSDLs and massively verbose XML, and despite being web based, you can't do anything as simple as access a SOAP service with a web browser.</p>

<p>So the essence of my question is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there any good reasons to ever choose SOAP over REST?</li>
<li>Are you working with SOAP now? Would it be better if the interface was REST?</li>
<li>Am I wrong?</li>

<p>The rest of the time, it connects right away without any issues.  Our applications that establish connections via JDBC don't seem to have any issues but we do when going through something that does a tnsnames.ora lookup (or that's my hunch at least).

<p>I have the SID of the DB, which is what the JDBC connections rely on but adding it to the tnsnames.ora doesn't improve the odds of making a connection.  I don't know enough about how the tnsnames file is being used by oracle to intelligently resolve this issue so if you have suggestions or see something that is obviously missing please let me know.</p>

We're using Forms Authentication. We're not talking about a session timeout, which we already have. We would like to know when a user has browsed away from our site, either via a link, by typing in an address or following a bookmark. If they return to our site, even if right away, they will have to log back in (I understand this is not great usability - this is a security requirement we've been given by our client).</p>

<p>My initial instinct is that this is either not possible, or that any solutions will be extremely unreliable. The only solutions we've come up with are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a JavaScript onBlur event handler that tells the server to log out the session when the user leaves the site.</li>
<li>Once the user has logged in, check the HTTP referrer to ensure that the user has navigated from within the site.</li>
<li>Add AJAX polling back to the server to keep the session refreshed, possibly on a 10-second interval. When the call isn't received on time the session would end.</li>
</ul>

<p>The onBlur seems like the easiest, but possibly least reliable method - I'm not sure if it would even work. There are also issues with the referrer method, as the user could type in an address within the site and not follow a link. The AJAX method seems like it would work, but it's complicated - I'm not even sure how to handle it on the back-end. I'm thinking there might also be scenarios in which that wouldn't always work.</p>

<p>Any ideas would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

    // The _MSIExecute mutex is used by the MSI installer service to serialize installations

<li>Some tools to create (preferably graphically) some vector graphics in some acceptable format;</li>
<li>A programmatic way of creating vector graphics.  For example, say I had a grid, I wouldn't necessarily want to draw that by hand.  ""Snap to Grid"" and similar features would cover this case but not others; and</li>
<li>Some way I can programmatically (eg as a build task) take a set of vector graphics and generate a set of images and preferably have some control (eg from the command line) over things like naming conventions, output format, size, etc.  I don't want to go into a program and individually do ""Save as..."" on 100+ files to generate my icons.</li>

I'm trying to position these Divs without effecting my other layout, they are behind the other layout. This works except for the fact that the background image doesn't follow the divs position.<br>

When you have a UIView in your iPhone application and you need to access it elsewhere in your application (generally in another function in a view controller), do you like to tag the view with an integer and retrieve it with the <code>viewWithTag:</code> message, or do you generally set it to a property in the view controller for easy access later?</p>

<p>Saving it as a property obviously makes it easier to retrieve later, but I would think there is some (perhaps negligible) amount of memory that is saved by tagging a view instead of setting it as an object property.</p>

<p>I've generally been creating properties on my view controllers, mainly because I'm lazy, and retrieving views with <code>viewWithTag:</code> is annoying.</p>

<p>Here is what I got:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$domain = 'www.example.com';
$deleteExpiration = time() - 60*60*24*365*10; // 10 years ago
foreach (array_keys($_COOKIE) as $cookie) {

}
</code></pre>

<p>Running this code on <a href=""http://www.example.com/delete_cookies.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.example.com/delete_cookies.php</a> deletes all cookies that were set on the server, but not cookies that were set in JavaScript. </p>

<p>I verified using the Firefox Cookies dialog that the problematic cookies are indeed from (path=/; domain=www.example.com). Using Live HTTP headers, I can see that the following header is sent:</p>

<pre><code>Set-Cookie: CookieName=0; expires=Fri, 12-Mar-1999 19:36:15 GMT; path=/; domain=www.example.com
</code></pre>

<p>So I believe the setcookie command is working as expected. Firefox is just not honoring the request.</p>

<p>One additional thing that I noticed is that if I set a cookie with <code>domain=www.example.com</code> on the server, then it is listed in the Firefox cookie dialog with <code>domain="".www.example.com""</code>, but if I set the following cookie using JavaScript code then the leading dot is not added.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? How can I delete these cookies?</p>

<p>I need this, because I have certain pages in that application, which sometimes do not need authentication to be accessed (based on some criteria), and I put them in a separate ""location"" directive in web.config with  in order to exclude them from ""catch all"" forms authentication.</p>

  <p>The balance factor of a node is the height of its right subtree minus the height of its left subtree and a node with balance factor 1, 0, or -1 is considered balanced. A node with any other balance factor is considered unbalanced and requires rebalancing the tree. The balance factor is either stored directly at each node or computed from the heights of the subtrees.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a.id, a.other, b.baz
FROM a
LEFT OUTER JOIN b
  ON a.id  = b.id
  AND b.bar = 'foo'
</code></pre>

<p>Expected results:</p>

<pre>
    id  other       baz      
    --  ----------  -------  
    1   Has foo     Include  
    2   Has none    (null)   
    3   Has foobar  (null)   
</pre>

<p>I can't get the same results by putting it in the filter condition. If I use the following:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a.id, a.other, b.baz
FROM a
LEFT OUTER JOIN b
  ON a.id  = b.id
WHERE (b.bar IS NULL OR b.bar = 'foo')
</code></pre>

<p>I get these incorrect results:</p>

<pre>
    id  other     baz      
    --  --------  -------  
    1   Has foo   Include  
    2   Has none  (null)   
</pre>

<p>Where it excluded records of A that happen to match a record of B where bar = 'foobar'. I don't want that, I want A to be present, but B to be nulls in that case.</p>

<p>Table B will have multiple records that need excluding, so I don't think I can filter this on the Crystal side without doing a lot of messing around to avoid problems from duplicate records from table A.</p>

<p>I cannot use a SQL command object, as the third party application that we are running the reports from seems to choke on SQL command objects.</p>

<p>I cannot use views, as our support contract does not permit database modifications, and our vendor considers adding views a database modification.</p>

<p>I am working with Crystal Reports XI, specifically version 11.0.0.895. In case it makes a difference, I am running against a Progress 9.1E04 database using the SQL-92 ODBC driver.</p>

<p>The sample tables and data used in the examples can be created with the following:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE a (id INTEGER, other VARCHAR(32));
CREATE TABLE b (id INTEGER, bar VARCHAR(32), baz VARCHAR(32));
insert into A (id, other) values ('1', 'Has foo');
insert into A (id, other) values ('2', 'Has none');
insert into A (id, other) values ('3', 'Has foobar');
insert into B (id, bar, baz) values ('1', 'foo', 'Include');
insert into B (id, bar, baz) values ('1', 'foobar', 'Exclude');
insert into B (id, bar, baz) values ('1', 'another', 'Exclude');

I have a few specific questions for anyone who has a strong CodeIgniter background:</p>

<p><strong>SESSIONS</strong></p>

<p>The CodeIgniter session stores session data on the client side in a cookie, which just isn't going to work for me. I know there are a few replacements for it, or I could build my own library/helper; but I just don't see any benefit over just using <code>$_SESSION</code>.</p>

<p>If I just use <code>$_SESSION</code>, will I have any problems with the rest of the framework? Does any other part of the framework depend on using the CodeIgniter session?</p>

<p>I feel a bit weird about stepping outside the framework for something so basic, but I am pretty comfortable with plain PHP. I am basically just looking to use CodeIgniter for MVC, and to enforce a more modular aspect for my projects.</p>

<p><strong>CODE FLOW &amp; CONFIG</strong></p>

<p>I have a few config items that need to be done before almost anything else.  </p>

<p>For example, say I have a constant <code>APP_LIVE</code>, which is set true/false based on the name of the current server. This has to happen really early as paths, error reporting, the CodeIgniter system, and application folders, etc. will be set based on it.</p>

<p>The problem is that the <code>system_folder</code>, and <code>application_folder</code> (which will be set based on which server the code is running on) are set first thing in the <code>index.php</code> file, before any of the configs have loaded.</p>

<p>Also, I have a functions that check for things in the URL, and may redirect before the page ever loads.  For example, some pages need to enfore the presence of <code>www.</code> in the URL (for SEO), track affiliates, visitor sources, marketing flags, etc.</p>

<p>Where is the best place to put things like this that have to happen really early?  I know there is a config file, an autoload file, a constants file, etc., but those are too late for some items. Is it a bad practice to simply put these things into the top of the main <code>index.php</code> file, or to make an include there to a global config file? Again, I feel like I am stepping outside the framework, and wonder if I'm just doing that because I don't have a solid understanding of it yet?</p>

<p><strong>LAYOUT / HEADER FOOTER</strong></p>

<p>Like most people, I have a top header, navigation, footer, etc. I am used to just having them in files, which are included into my page template. I believe I can do that the same way by just making them views and including them into my main page view. Is that the best way to go?  Some of them need a bit of data; like what page they are on for the navigation, etc. What's the best way to handle navigation, shared header/footer, etc.?</p>

Since extension methods are nothing but static methods you could argue that it should be ArgumentNullException, but on the other hand they're used like instance methods so it might be more natural to use the NullReferenceException. Let's take the following example:</p>

<pre><code>public static string ToInvariantString(this IFormattable value, string format)
{
    return value.ToString(format, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way a NullReferenceException will be thrown if the value parameter is null. </p>

<p>The other example would be:</p>

<pre><code>public static string ToInvariantString(this IFormattable value, string format)
{
    if (value == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(""value"");
    return value.ToString(format, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
In some of the answers you have pointed out that an extension methods can be called like a static method and in those cases a null reference exception would be wrong, which is a great point, and actually one of my concerns, not sure why I forgot to mention that in the question in the first place. </p>

<p>Someone also pointed out that it's wrong to throw a NullReferenceException, and yes, it is. That's why I don't throw it, I just let it happen (let the CLR throw it) by not guarding the method.</p>

<p>I think I favor the ArgumentNullException (that's what I've use so far) but I still think there is at least room to argue for an against the NullReferenceException since it seems more natural in most places where the method is going to be used.</p>

<p>I've got a program that has a thread (thread1) waiting on a select for a UDP socket to become readable.
I'm using the select (with my socket as the single readfd and the single exceptfd) instead of just calling recvfrom because I want a timeout. </p>

<p>From another thread, I shutdown and close the socket. 
If I do this while thread1 is blocked in a recvfrom, then the recvfrom will terminate immediately. 
If I do this while thread1 is blocked in a select with a timeout, then the select will NOT terminate immediately, but will eventually timeout properly.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me why it is that the select doesn't exit as soon as the socket is closed? Isn't that an exception? I can see where it isn't readable (obviously), but it's closed, which seems to be to be exeptional.</p>

<p>Here's the opening of the socket (all error handling removed to keep things simple):</p>

<pre><code>m_sockfd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
struct sockaddr_in si_me;
memset((char *) &amp;si_me, 0, sizeof(si_me));
si_me.sin_family = AF_INET;
si_me.sin_port = htons(port);
si_me.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);
if (bind(m_sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)(&amp;si_me), sizeof(si_me)) &lt; 0)
{
// deal with error
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the select statement that thread1 executes:</p>

<pre><code>struct timeval to;
to.tv_sec = timeout_ms/1000;// just the seconds portion
to.tv_usec = (timeout_ms%1000)*1000;// just the milliseconds 
                                    // converted to microseconds

// watch our one fd for readability or
// exceptions.
fd_set  readfds, exceptfds;
FD_ZERO(&amp;readfds);
FD_SET(m_sockfd, &amp;readfds);
FD_ZERO(&amp;exceptfds);
FD_SET(m_sockfd, &amp;exceptfds);

int nsel = select(m_sockfd+1, &amp;readfds, NULL, &amp;exceptfds, &amp;to);
</code></pre>

<p>UPDATE: Obviously (as stated below), closing the socket isn't an exceptional condition (from select's point of view). I think what I need to know is: Why? And, Is that intentional?. </p>

<p>I REALLY want to understand the thinking behind this select behavior because it seems counter to my expectations. Thus, I obviously need to adjust my thinking on how the TCP stack works. Please explain it to me.</p>

<pre><code>RptInvoicing.Destination := 0; // To: window
RptInvoicing.Action := 1; // Execute

<p>However, this does not fly with CR XI. Printing and exporting I've figured out to work like this:</p>

<pre><code>crReport.PrintOut(True);
...
crReport.Export(True);

<p>But I haven't been able to find anything relevant to show the default preview window. I've tried implementing my own using the report viewer component, but it has a lot of problems like locking up when resizing, freezing and crashes, so it's not a viable solution for a production app.</p>

<p>Even the official support forums weren't of help, I only got a nasty answer to go look at the manuals, which I've been through several times and can only refer to as bad. It's not every day you see such bad documentation for an enterprise product. I found nothing relevant to this in their manuals, so I'm led to think their own staff have no idea about this either.</p>

<p>So I'm hoping someone here could tell me if the default report viewer still exists in CR XI, and if it does, how to invoke it? If it doesn't, is using the report designer component really the only solution to create one?</p>

<p>The short version is that I have many html pages, each with a form that accepts input, but never saves the input anywhere- they are only ever printed out for mailing.  A previously developer who had never heard of <code>@media print</code> did the initial work on most of them, and so he came up with some... <em>odd</em> solutions to hide the ugly text boxes on the printed page, usually resulting in two completely separate copies of nearly the same html.  Unfortunately, that broke the back button in many cases, and so now I must go back and fix them.  </p>

<hr>

<p>In some cases, these html forms really are form letters, with text inputs in the middle of the text.  I can style the text inputs so that the box doesn't show, but they are still the wrong size.  This results in a bunch of extra ugly whitespace where it doesn't belong.  How can make the inputs fit the text entered by the user?</p>

<p>The best I can come up with at the moment is to have a hidden &lt;span> next to each input that is styled to show instead of the input when printing, and use javascript to keep it in sync.  But this is ugly.  I'm looking for something better.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><br>
Most of our users are still in IE6, but we have some IE7 and firefox out there.</p>

<p><strong>Update2:</strong><br>
I re-thought this a little to use a label rather than a span.  I'll maintain the relationship using the label's <code>for</code> attribute.  See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/285522/find-html-label-associated-with-a-given-input"">this question</a> for my final code.</p>

<p>Sometimes a report can exist in up to 5 different locations, and I need to generate a list of all the locations of the most recent version of each report.</p>

<p>I can do it easily using code, or redirecting ""dir"" or ""ls"" output into a text file and then manipulating it in Excel, but I'd prefer a simpler (hopefully a one-liner) solution either using DOS, bash, or PowerShell.</p>

<p>The best I've come up with so far in PowerShell (I've done something similar using bash) is:</p>

<pre><code>ls -r -fi *.lis | sort @{expression={$_.Name}}, @{expression={$_.LastWriteTime};Descending=$true} | select Directory, Name, lastwritetime

<p>That will recursively list all files with *.lis extension, then sort it by name (asc) and date (desc), and then display the directory, name, and date.  </p>

<p>This gives this sort of output:</p>

<p>What I obviously need to do now is remove the files that aren't the most recent versions, so that the output looks like this (not too worried about formatting yet):</p>

Some good ideas and answers to this question.  Unfortunately I can't mark all as accepted, but EBGreen's (edited) answer worked without modification.  I'll add working solutions here as I verify them.</p>

<p>I think I'm missing some fundamental basics here.  Do I need to set up some certificates?  Or should it all just work as it seems to do when I use NetTcpBinding?</p>

<p>There is a 32-bit application (electronic trading application called CQG) which provides a COM API for external access.  I have sample programs and scripts which access this API from Excel, .NET (C++, VB and C#) and shell VBScript.  I have these .NET applications as source code and as compiled executables (32-bit, compiled on Windows XP).</p>

<p>Now I have Windows Vista Home 64-bit which makes my head to spin. Excel examples work just fine (in Excel 2003).  Compiled .NET sample executables work as well.</p>

<p>But when I am trying to run .NET C# sample converted to and compiled by Visual Studio C# Expression, or run the VBScript script, I am getting error 80004005 when trying to create an object.  Initially the .NET application also gave me 80040154 but then I figured how to make it produce 32-bit code and not 64-bit, so now the errors in C# and VBScript applications are the same. That's all the progress I got for now.</p>

<p>And yes, I tried running 32-bit versions of cscript.exe/WScript from SysWOW64 folder on my VBS, but still the result is the same (80004005).</p>

<p>How to solve this problem?  I am almost ready to believe it is practically impossible, but the fact that Excel VBA works and .NET executables compiled on Windows XP run just fine just makes me angry.  There should be a way to beat this thing (some secret which probably only Windows Vista developers know)!  I will appreciate any help!</p>

<p>PS: I believe code samples do not make much sense here, but this is the line of VBScript which fails:</p>

<pre><code>Set CEL = WScript.CreateObject(""CQG.CQGCEL.4.0"", ""CEL_"")
</code></pre>

<p>And this is C#:</p>

<pre><code>CQGCEL CEL = new CQGCEL();
</code></pre>

<p>Update: Forgot to say <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UAC</a> is off, of course. And I am working from account with administrator priviledges.</p>

<p>I also tried watching which registry keys are read using Process Monitor but everything looks OK for GUIDs of this object.  I could not recognize some other GUIDs so I am not sure whether they were critical or not.</p>

<p>Is there a chance that this COM object uses Internet Explorer and gets the wrong one (like Internet Explorer 7 instead of Internet Explorer 6 engine or something)?</p>

At certain times, on certain machines, when there's more than 5 clients requesting data, it seems to reach a deadlock.  If I step in to debug the problem, then the program appears to be processing.  Simply setting a break point where I know the program is executing, and causing it to hit the breakpoint a few times causes it to finish. If I insert Thread.Sleep(0) at certain points in the code, mostly around some cpu intensive loops, it seems to pretty much totally resolve the problem.  The one problem that I have now is that if I call Thread.Sleep(0) too much, it can slow down the code.  If I don't call it enough, the code seems to be in deadlock.  Although I can verify that it isn't in deadlock because if I step into the code, it causes the problem to disappear, simply because I'm pausing a thread. </p>

<p>Is there a good way to track down exactly what is causing this.  It seems that it only happens on my laptop which is running Vista, but not on my desktop which is running Windows XP.  However, it's impossible to debug, because simply stepping into the code causes the problem to go away.  I've read comments that calling Thread.Sleep(0) is a bad practice, and shouldn't be necessary, and I don't like putting witchcraft type code into my applications that I don't understand why it has to be there.  Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>[EDIT]
I can also verify that the code is still running when it is ""deadlocked"" because if I leave it long enough, it will finish, only the amount of time it takes is many orders of magnitude higher.  I mean like it's actually at least 100 times slower when it's in this ""deadlocked"" mode.  The CPU is pegged at 80-95%, so it is working, altough what it is doing is beyond me, because it's taking forever to complete the task.</p>

<p>[More Info]
Just because everybody here is insistent that it's a deadlock, I removed all the code that did any locking. There was only a couple lines of code that did any locking whatsoever. The threads work completely independantly for the most part, so it wasn't much work to remove the locking completely.  Still the problem persists.  There is no more synclocks in my code, no more mutex's no more stuff that I see see that would cause a deadlock, but the problem is still there.  And it's not deadlocked.  It runs, albeit very slowly, even though it's eating up all the processor resources.</p>

If the window is resized smaller and the children don't have enough room, they collapse from their horizontal orientation (which I don't want). To fix this, I know I can set a min-width of the DIV container, the issue is that there is a variable amount of DIVs in the container, of variable width. I'd like to simulate being able to set a min-width where of the container where min-width = width of all children, but I cannot compute these because they are variable (which would simulate flexible space between the right div and the rest, but not let them get closer than they should be allowed (hence collapsing the divs)).</p>

Specifically, if I am designing a class that needs a way to log, how should I go about getting an interface to log to keeping dependency injection in mind?</p>

<p>Dependency injection seems to state that external dependencies should be injected from the outside (constructor or property setters), so should I take an ILog instance in the constructor and use in the class? Should I consider logging an optional dependency and get it in a setter? Am I pushing for too much flexibility by allowing for the logging interface to change and should I just take a hard dependency on a specific logging interface (by e.g. create a static ILog variable via a call to a factory method)? Could this factory method call into the container to get the ILog implementation or will this create initialization conflicts between static variables being initialization and the IoC container being initialized?</p>

<p>Should I be doing this:</p>

<p>I was going for write-locked file handle contention in the previous example, but since most OSes allocate filehandles per-process there will be no contention there. (Kudos to @Miles for pointing out the example didn't make too much sense.) Here's my revised example, which shows a real deadlock condition:</p>

<pre><code>import threading

lock = threading.Lock()

def coroutine():
    with lock:
        yield 'spam'
        yield 'eggs'

generator = coroutine()
assert generator.next()
with lock: # Deadlock!
    print 'Outside the coroutine got the lock'
assert generator.next()

My understanding is that by default the ToolProvider will create the JavaCompiler instance with the system classloader.</p>

<p>Is there a way to specify a classloader for JavaCompiler to use?</p>

Can I dynamically redefine Perl methods? Say I have a class like this one:</p>

<pre><code>package MyClass;
sub new {
  my $class = shift;
  my $val = shift;
  my $self = { val=&gt; $val};

  bless($self, $class);

sub get_val {

  return $self-&gt;{val}+10;
}
1;

<p>And let's say that adding two numbers is really expensive.</p>

<p>I'd like to modify the class so that $val+10 is only computed the first time I call the method on that object. Subsequent calls to the method would return a cached value.</p>

<p>I could easily modify the method to include caching, but:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a bunch of methods like this.</li>
<li>I'd rather not dirty up this method.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I really want to do is specify a list of methods that I know always return the same value for a given instance. I then want to take this list and pass it to a function to add caching support to those methods</p>

<p>Is there an effective way to accomplish this?</p>

<p>Follow up. The code below works, but because use strict doesn't allow references by string I'm not 100% where I want to be.</p>

<pre><code>sub myfn {
  printf(""computing\n"");

}
sub cache_fn {
  my $fnref = shift;

  my $cacheval;

  return sub {
    if (defined($cacheval)) { return $cacheval; }
    $cacheval = &amp;$orig();

I have been studying this program and when protected mode is enabled there is a far jump executed by directly assembling the opcode and operands as data within the program. This was for the GNU assembler:</p>

<p><pre><code>
         /* this code immediately follows the setting of the PE flag in CR0 */</p>

<pre><code>.byte   0x66, 0xEA
.long   TARGET_ADDRESS
.word   0x0010          /* descriptor #2, GDT, RPL=0 */
</code></pre>

<p></pre></code></p>

<p>First of all, why would one want to do this (instead of the instruction mnemonic)?</p>

<p>I have been looking at the Intel manuals, but am still a little confused by the code. Specifically in Volume 2A, page 3-549, there is a table of opcodes. The relevant entry:</p>

<pre>
EA *cp* JMP ptr16:32  Inv.  Valid  Jump far, absolute, address given in
operand
</pre>

<p>The actual opcode is obvious, but the the first byte, 0x66, has me confused. Referring to the table in the Intel manual, the cp apparently means that a 6 byte operand will follow. And obviously 6 bytes follow in the next two lines. 0x66 encodes an 'Operand-size override prefix'. What does this have to do with the cp in the table? I was expecting there to be some hex value for the cp, but instead there is this override prefix. Can someone please clear this up for me?</p>

<p>Here is a dump from od:</p>

<pre>
c022    **ea66    0000    0001    0010**    ba52    03f2    c030
</pre>

<p>TARGET_ADDRESS was defined as 0x00010000.</p>

<p>I am also confused a bit by the significance of the last two bytes. However, that seems to be another question altogether. It is getting quite late, and I have been staring at code and the Intel manuals for hours, so I hope I got my point across.</p>

<p>Thanks for looking!</p>

<p>Other domains that should be covered in my standards should be how test classes are set up and how to organize them. For example if you have class called OrderLineProcessor there should be a test class called OrderLineProcessorTest. If there's a method called Process() on that class then there should be a test called ProcessTest (maybe more to test different states).</p>

Ideally, I'd use <code>iptables</code> and the <code>netfilter</code> kernel module, but they don't support generic payload mangling: <code>iptables</code> will alter various <em>header</em> fields (addresses, ports, TOS, etc), and it can <em>match</em> arbitrary bytes within a packet, but it apparently is unable to <em>alter</em> arbitrary data within the packet.</p>

<p>A kernel module would be a big plus, as efficiency is a concern, but I'm happy to explore any other options that would get the job done.</p>

<p>Thanks for your ideas!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Long-overdue Update:</strong></p>

<p>We chose to use the <code>NFQUEUE</code> module, which is the latest implementation of the QUEUE modules that Robert Gamble suggested.  It appeared to be fairly simple, with a safety bonus for allowing our code to run in user, not kernel, space.</p>

<p>The implementation would have been almost trivial if we'd simply wanted to alter the payload without changing its size.  In that case, we'd define an <a href=""http://netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>iptables</code></a> rule to select the ""interesting"" packets for us and send them an <code>NFQUEUE</code> target.  We'd write a callback function that would inspect the packets from <code>NFQUEUE</code>, modify the data as required, and recalculate the checksums in their TCP and IP headers.</p>

<p>However, our use case involves injecting additional characters into the data stream.  This has the somewhat obvious side-effect of increasing the corresponding SEQ/ACK numbers in the TCP stream, and the not-so-obvious side-effect of confusing the <a href=""http://kalamazoolinux.org/presentations/20010417/conntrack.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>conntrack</code></a> module enough that it breaks NAT entirely.  After a <em>lot</em> of research, head-scratching, and experimentation, the most expedient solution was to disable connection tracking for these particular packets (with the <code>NOTRACK</code> target in the <code>raw</code> table) and handle it in our callback.  <em>Save your tomatoes and hate mail; I'm not at all proud to let you under the hood, but it was the only way to get a reliable product to the customer before the next Ice Age.  And it's a good story.  But I truly appreciate, and share, your heartfelt sentiments.</em></p>

<p>Version 2 will leverage our newfound enlightenment by replacing our callback and several <code>iptables</code> rules with a custom NAT and/or <a href=""http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO/netfilter-hacking-HOWTO-4.html#ss4.4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>conntrack</code> helper</a>.  We're confident that the current exercise has given us enough experience to create a kernel module that will fit organically into the netfilter architecture to solve the problems we encountered.</p>

<p>In Microsoft Assembler (MASM) the dollar symbol ($) serves as the current location counter, which would be useful for my purpose. But again this does not seem to work in Borlands Assember (expression syntax error).</p>

<p>Update: To be a little more specific, I need the compiler to generate the address it moves into eax as a constant during compilation/linking and not at run time, so it will compile like ""mov eax, 0x00401234"".</p>

<p>Can anybody suggest how to get this working?</p>

<p>UPDATE: To respond to Pax's question (see comment), If the base address is changed at run time by the Windows loader the DLL/EXE PE image will still be relocated by the Windows loader and the labels address will be patched at run time by the loader to use the re-based address so using a compile/link time value for the label address is not an issue.</p>

<p>I'm using Delphi 2009 so now that PChar is Unicode,</p>

<pre><code>SetString(OutputString, PChar(Output), OutputLength.Value);
edtString.Text := edtString.Text + OutputString;
</code></pre>

<p>Works and I changed it to PChar myself but since the data being moved isn't always Unicode in fact its usually ShortString Data.... so onto what he actually gave me to use:</p>

<pre><code>SetString(OutputString, PAnsiChar(Output), OutputLength.Value);
edtString.Text := edtString.Text + OutputString;
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing shows up but I check in the debugger and the text that normally appeared the way I did it building 1 char at a time in the past was in the variable.</p>

<p>Oddly enough this is not the first time I ran into this tonight. Because I was trying to come up with another way, I took part of his advice and instead of building into a VCL's TCaption I built it into a string variable and then copied it, but when I send it over nothing's displayed. Once again in the debugger the variable that the data is built in... has the data.</p>

<pre><code>for I := 0 to OutputLength.Value - 1 do
begin
  OutputString := OutputString + Char(OutputData^[I]);
end;
edtString.Text := OutputString;
</code></pre>

<p>The above does not work but the old slow way of doing it worked just fine....</p>

<pre><code>for I := 0 to OutputLength.Value - 1 do
begin
  edtString.Text := edtString.Text + Char(OutputData^[I]);
end;
</code></pre>

<p>I tried making the variable a ShortString, String and TCaption and nothing is displayed.  What I also find interesting is while I build my hex data from the same array into a richedit it's very fast while doing it inside an edit for the text data is very very slow.  Which is why I haven't bothered trying to change the code for the richedit as it works superfast as it is.</p>

<p>Edit to add - I think I sorta found the problem but I have no solution.  If I edit the value in the debugger to remove anything that can't be displayed (which by the old method used to just not display... not fail) then what I have left is displayed.  So if it's just a matter of getting rid of bytes that were turned to characters that are garbage how can I fix that?</p>

<p>I basically have incoming raw data from a SCSI device that's being displayed hex-editor style. My original slow style of adding one char at a time successfully displayed strings and Unicode strings that did not have Unicode-specific characters in them.  The faster methods even if working won't display ShortStrings one way and the other way wont display UnicodeStrings that aren't using non 0-255 characters.  I really like and could use the speed boost but if it means sacrificing the ability to read the string... then what's the point in the app?</p>

<p>EDIT3 - Alright now that I've figured out that 0-31 is control char and 32 and up is valid I think I'm gonna make an attempt to filter char and replace those not valid with a . which is something I was planning on doing later to emulate hex editor style.</p>

<p>If there are any other suggestions I'd be glad to hear about them but otherwise I think I can craft a solution that's faster than the original and does what I need it to at the same time.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I struggle with this is not just due to a C or C++ vs Java language difference, it's the fundamental skills that come with learning C or C++ that I think often get lost at the Java School. These include data structures, computational complexity, manual memory management, really everything Joel Spolsky says <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Often, as far as I can tell, a student will have some of those fundamental skills (be able to answer a few questions), but I'll still have this large part of my mind that's extremely skeptical with how well someone can learn these skills without getting their hands dirty in some C or C++. Maybe I need to be disabused of this stereotype. Am I just being unfair?</p>

<p>Anyway whats your experience with turning the ""Java School"" programmer into a C or C++ programmer?</p>

<pre><code>static void Main()                  // args are OK here, of course
{
    bool ok;
    m = new System.Threading.Mutex(true, ""YourNameHere"", out ok);

    if (! ok)
    {
        MessageBox.Show(""Another instance is already running."");
        return;
    }

    Application.Run(new Form1());   // or whatever was there

    GC.KeepAlive(m);                // important!
}
</code></pre>

<p>He explains that the GC.KeepAlive(m) is required to prevent the garbage collector from collecting the mutex early, since there are no additional references to it.</p>

<p>My question:  will wrapping the mutex in a using do the same thing?  That is, will the following also prevent the GC from pulling the rug out from under me?</p>

<pre><code>static void Main()                  // args are OK here, of course
{
    bool ok;
    using (var m = new System.Threading.Mutex(true, ""YourNameHere"", out ok))
    {
        if (! ok)
        {
            MessageBox.Show(""Another instance is already running."");
            return;
        }

        Application.Run(new Form1());   // or whatever was there
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My gut reaction is that the using will work, since using is (supposed to be) equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>Mutex m = new System.Threading.Mutex(true, ""YourNameHere"", out ok);
try
{
    // do stuff here
}
finally
{
    m.Close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I would think that the m.Close() there would be enough to signal to the JIT compiler that there's another reference, thus preventing premature garbage collection.</p>

I found one solution, by Messju over at Smarty that seemed to be just right - but it is not supported and fails in the latest version of smarty :(</p>

<p>For people asking: What I want smarty to print out is a discussion thread that is defined by an array of entries. If an entry has one or more answers, those are listed as children to said entry in an array, and so on.</p>

<pre><code>array(
    array(
        'id'=&gt;0,
        'headline'=&gt;""My parent headline"",
        'body'    =&gt;""My parent body"",
        'children'=&gt;array(
            array(
                'id'=&gt;1,
                'headline'=&gt;""My firstChild headline"",
                'body'    =&gt;""My firstChild body"",
                'children'=&gt;array()
            ),
            array(
                'id'=&gt;2,
                'headline'=&gt;""My secondChild headline"",
                'body'    =&gt;""My secondChild body"",
                'children'=&gt;array()
            )
        )
    ),
);
</code></pre>

<p>The nested array has an arbitrary depth, and each entry will have an arbitrary number of children. To me this is something I want to do with within the scope of the template, as I consider it pure display logic. I do not want to have to handle HTML or some type of HTML placeholders outside of the template.</p>

<p>I want smarty to print this as nested lists:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;My parent headline&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My parent body&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;My firstChild headline&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;My firstChild body&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<p>I'm starting to realize this might be a very case-by-case problem, so I figure I'll just write a smarty plugin to handle this specifically, although I'd rather have an all-around solution.</p>

<p>The main problem is that you can only use the RefEdit control on a VBA UserForm (<a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q281542/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Microsoft states this</a>, and my tests confirm it too).  I'm making an Excel add-in using <strong>Delphi</strong>, and I'm looking for an <strong>alternative to the RefEdit control</strong>.</p>

<p><code>Excel.Application.InputBox Type:=8</code> is one alternative way of selecting a range of cells, but it's not very user-friendly when you need people to select <em>multiple</em> ranges of cells on a single form.  The best real alternative I have at the moment is to call a VBA form from my Delphi add-in, but that's far from ideal.</p>

<p>So ideally I could do with a <em>drop-in replacement for RefEdit</em> - one that I can use on a Delphi form.  If there is one, it's not easy to find (I've been searching pretty hard, and I've not been able to find a drop-in RefEdit replacement for Delphi, VB6, or .NET).</p>

<p>Failing a drop-in replacement I might try cobbling together my own alternative, but I suspect it would be difficult if not impossible to make one that works as well as RefEdit.  RefEdit lets you ""select"" cells without actually selecting them: it uses marching ants around the cells that you choose instead of highlighting them and changing the <code>Excel.Application.Selection</code>.  I don't know of a way to do that by manipulating the Excel object model through VBA, Delphi, or whatever.</p>

<p>Any tips, tricks, hacks, or, if I'm really lucky, pointers to drop-in RefEdit replacements would be most welcome.</p>

<p>The problem is, that after collecting all of my drawing data, the drawing should take place at exactly the right moment in time, resulting in a steady animation.

<p>I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this problem, and can perhaps explain it. I'm building a simple Winforms app and trying to use many of the built in controls. </p>

<p>Basically, I've got a form with a user control and some data capture fields. 3 of the fields are dropdown lists and on the user control I have a bindingSource control that binds directly to a Product class.</p>

<p>At run time I provide an instance of the Product class to the BindingSource and the class contains a property of <code>ProductType</code>. For simplicity I also added a <code>List&lt;ProductType&gt;</code> ProductTypes to the Product Class which loads itself when queried, which means I can just use the same bindingSource and choose the <code>ProductTypes</code> Data Member as the Datasource for the dropdownlist.</p>

<p>Upon running the form, the list binds perfectly and I can see all the product types listed, and I can select one and tab or click to the next field. But obviously the selected value won't bind because I've not chosen any bindings-SelectedValue for the dropdown, only a datasource. As soon as I make sure that the drop down modifies the instance of the Product by binding to the Bindings-SelectedValue, and then run the form, the list still gets populated perfectly and I can tab through the controls as long as I don't make a selection from the dropdown. If I make a selection from the dropdown then the dropdown <strong>holds focus</strong>. I cannot tab out for love or money and can't even click cancel button on the form, the close button top right is the only button I can click which works and I can't click any other field or dropdown. This affects all three dropdowns as soon as a selection is made.</p>

<p>Anyone have any ideas what I'm missing?</p>

<p>I have tried changing a few things and had some success by feeding the dropdown values a string[] instead of a member of an object. That seems to work, but defeats the object of using databinding doesn't it?</p>

Modules could define their own resource dictionaries and all pull from the main application's resource dictionary for common brushes and such.</p>

With 16 sub-dictionaries, the number of collisions is pretty low on a 4-core machine.</p>

<p>For parallel insertions, i locked the Add-method with a <code>ReaderWriterLockSlim</code>, locking only the individual sub-dictionary:</p>

CPU usage was now at nearly 100% and the performance was more than doubled. </p>

<p>My question is: Why did the CPU usage increase? The number of collisions should not have changed. What makes ReaderWriterLock.EnterWriteLock wait so many times?</p>

<p>now prop2 could be a null object (because it doesn't exists in XML Message - an optional element in XSD). right now I need to check for null for each element in the hierarchy before accessing the leaf element. i.e I've to check if instance[0], prop1, prop2 are not null, before accessing 'ID'.</p>

<p>Is there a better way that avoids null-checking for each element in the hierarchy?</p>

I'd like to change the values of a vector of 883 values basing on a neighbour matrix constructed with nb2mat from a shapefile: if i and j (two cells) are neighbour (matrix) and i or j have a positive value in the vector, I'd like to transform the value of both i and j to 1 (positive), otherwise the value of i and j should remain 0.

"202384","1","","","2008-10-14 18:56:40","","5","6299","<p>I have trouble.  One of the users of an application I'm developing is occasionally, but regularly, experiencing an application hang.</p>

<p>When this happens, we find an entry with a source of ""Application Hang"" in the machine's Event Log, with the informative message ""Hanging application [my app], version [the right version], hang module hungapp, version 0.0.0.0, hang address 0x00000000.""</p>

<p>I'm logging all unhandled exceptions that my application throws, and there aren't any entries in my log files when this happens.</p>

<p>My current working hypothesis is that this hang is occurring during the application's call to an unsafe legacy API.  This wouldn't astonish me; I've been working with this API for years and while I haven't seen it hang before, it's genuinely crappy code.  Also, the user's reporting that the program seems to hang at random times.  I don't think this is really true.  Not that I don't believe her, but that the code that talks to the legacy API is running inside a method called by a BackgroundWorker.  If the background thread were making the application hang, this could very much look to the user like it were happening randomly.</p>

<p>So, I have two questions, one specific, one general.</p>

<p>The specific question:    I would expect that if a method running on a non-UI thread were to hang, it would just kill the thread.  Would it actually kill the whole application?</p>

<p>The general question:</p>

<p>I'm already logging all unhandled exceptions.  My program's already set up to use tracing (though I'm going to need to add instrumentation code to trace activity in suspect methods).  Are there other things I should be doing?  Are there diagnostic tools that allow some kind of post-crash analysis when  a .NET application hangs?  Are there mechanisms inside the .NET framework that I can invoke to capture more (and more usable) data?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  On a closer examination of my code, I'm remembering that all of its usage of BackgroundWorker is through a utility class I implemented that wraps the method called in an exception handler.  This handler logs the exception and then returns it as a propoerty of the utility object.  The completion event handler in the UI thread re-throws the exception (less than ideal, since I lose the call stack, but it's already been logged), causing the UI's main exception handler to report the exception to a message box and then terminate the app.</p>

<p>Since none of that is happening, I'm pretty confident that there's no exception being thrown in the background thread.  Well, no .NET exception, anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Further followup:</strong></p>

<p>Mercifully, I've now gotten enough data from the users to be certain that the hang isn't occurring inside the legacy API.  This means it's clearly something I'm doing wrong, which means that I can fix it, so, win.  It also means that I can isolate the problem through tracing, which is another win.  I'm very happy at the answers I got to this question; I""m even happier that I probably don't need them for this problem.</p>

<p>Also:  PostSharp is outstanding.  If you need to add instrumentation code to an existing application, you almost certainly should be using it.</p>

<p>I managed to solve this by using sqlite to put the objects to tables and thus effectively manage the data but this is no longer a possible solution (for reasons I wont go into here).</p>

<p>What suggestions do you have for managing this sort of thing ? 
I have no (real) databases to use so I am thinking that a solution would be to somehow mimick the sqlite procedure and use some file back storage - is there anything that exists in pure dot net already or is it a complicated roll your own situation? </p>

<p>At moment I stick to following rule: </p>

<p>If event handler code manipulates very small portion of it's view (for example button click event handler increases font of certain TextBlock that's located on the same view) then it's OK to implement logic inside event handlers. But if View needs to manipulate business logic or access resources that are outside of view, then I assign these responsibilities to ViewModel.</p>

<p>Edit to clarify: The ApplicationProxy solution doesn't work because of the bolded text above.

I am attempting to size an iframe based on the height of it's content.  Both the page that contains the iframe and it's source page exist on the same domain.</p>

<p>I have tried the proposed solutions in each of the following threads: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/525992/resize-iframe-height-according-to-content-height-in-it"">Resize iframe height according to content height in it</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/153152/resizing-an-iframe-based-on-content"">Resizing an iframe based on content</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I believe that the solutions above are not working because of when the reference to body.clientHeight is made, the browser has not actually determined the height of the document.</p>

<p>Here is the code I am using:</p>

<pre><code>    var ifmBlue = document.getElementById(""ifmBlue"");
    ifmBlue.onload = resizeIframe;

    function resizeIframe()
    {
        var ifmBlue = document.getElementById(""ifmBluePill"");
        var ifmDiv = ifmBlue.contentDocument.getElementById(""main"");
        var height = ifmDiv.clientHeight;
        ifmBlue.style.height = (ifmBlue.contentDocument.body.scrollHeight || ifmBlue.contentDocument.body.offsetHeight || ifmBlue.contentDocument.body.parentNode.clientHeight || height ||  500) + 5 + 'px';
    }
</code></pre>

<p>If I debug the script using fire debug, the client height of the iframe.contentDocument's main div is 0.  Additionally, body.offsetHieght, &amp; body.scrollHeight are 0.  However, after the script is finished running, if I inspect the DOM of the HTML iframe element (using fire debug) I can see that the body's clientHeight is 456 and the inner div's clientHeight is 742.  This leads me to believe that these values are not yet set when iframe.onload is fired.  So, per one of the threads above, I moved the code into the body.onload event handler of the iframe's source page.  This solution also did not work.</p>

<p>Any help you can provide is much appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

Especially when using masterpages and tryin to just get the data to the masterpage without bypassing the controller. This question started off by me asking a lot of little questions, but then I managed to mould it into a solution which as yet I have not implemented but one which is somewhat workable. Would appreciate any feedback.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>My proposed solution aka 'what i am about to implement unless someone says stop!'</strong></p>

<p>I have my model classes inheriting from ModelBase -- which contains the information needed by the masterpage (there is only one view per page) for certain things it displays in the masthead or footer as well as configuration driven settings based upon who is logged in. </p>

<p>My best solution is as follows - shown here for a 'products page':</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Assumption</em>: I have at some point already stuck certain data in session - for instance perhaps a <code>partnerId</code> which came in through a gateway page, or a <code>currentLoggedInUserEmail</code> property or a fully blown object.</p>
  
  <p>I have a <code>ModelBase</code> class from which every model - such as <code>ProductModel</code> inherits</p>
  
  <p>I have a <code>MySiteControllerBase</code> class (inherits from Controller) - which is subclassed by <code>ProductController</code>.</p>
  
  <p>In my action method in <code>ProductController</code> I create the model for the product view with <code>'new ProductModel()'</code>. This model class itself knows nothing about session or how to populate <code>ModelBase</code>. It essentially doesn't even know about <code>ModelBase</code> - it just inherits from it. My chained constructor does nothing (because I don't want to pass it <code>Session</code>).</p>
  
  <p>I override <code>View(...)</code> in <code>MySiteControllerBase</code> for all the overloads that take a model parameter. I check to see if that parameter is of type <code>ModelBase</code> and if it is I populate the properties such as <code>partnerid</code> and <code>currentLoggedInuserEmail</code>. Fortunately because I'm inside a class that inherits from <code>Controller</code> I have direct access to <code>Session</code> so i can pull them straight out of there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This method means that the properties on <code>ModelBase</code> are automatically populated just by me doing <code>'return View(model)'</code>. However there is an obvious issue if the model for <code>ProductModel</code> needs to access anything defined on <code>ModelBase</code>. It's going to get null because it isn't populated yet.</p>

<p>This issue can be solved by passing in <code>Session</code> to <code>new ProductModel(session)</code> which would in turn pass it up the constructor chain to <code>new ModelBase(session)</code>. I really <em>dont</em> like that solution though becasue I like to think of a model as a pretty dumb data structure that shouldn't know about any external data constructs at all. Another solution might be to just wing it, and if i ever find that <code>ProductController</code> needs to consume anything defined in <code>ModelBase</code> that I just create a method <code>MySiteControllerBase.UpdateModelBase(productModel, session)</code> to explicitly populate it inside <code>ProductController</code>. I hope thats clear!</p>

<p>Other questions that come to mind are :</p>

<ul>
<li>What about unit testing? Is there any abstraction around Session state in MVC or should I build my own? I did a search in the sourcecode for 'session' and nothing came up!</li>
<li>How does session tracking work with /REST/FUL/URLS in MVC? Are there any issues ith cookies off that I need to know about?</li>
<li>Should I think of session differently from how I traditionally have?</li>

It was indeed because multiple selections were made.
This was because on creation I set the selected value to theItems.Where(i=>i.someCriterea) and I forgot to put .FirstOrDefault() at the end. Ending up in the possibility of multiple answers.
Since it was an IEnumerable, it was a lazy list and hence the WhereListIterator I guess.
I solved it by simple putting FirstOrDefault at the end.</p>

<ul>
<li>distributed blob storage (aka S3)</li>
<li>asynchronous, durable message queues (aka SQS) </li>
<li>non-Relational-/non-transactional databases (like SimpleDB, Google BigTable, Azure SQL Services)</li>
<li>distributed background worker pool</li>
<li>load-balanced, edge-service processes handling user requests (often virtualized)</li>
<li>distributed caches (like memcached)</li>
<li>CDN (content delivery network like Akamai)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now when it comes to design and sketch an architecture that makes use of such patterns, are there any commonly used symbols I could use? Or even a download with some cool Visio stencils? :)</p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be a formal system like UML but I think it would be great if there were symbols that everyone knows and understands, like we have commonly used shapes for databases or a documents, for example. I think it would be important to not mix it up with traditional concepts like a normal file system (local or network server/SAN), or a relational database. </p>

<p>Simply speaking, I want to be able to draw some conclusions about an application’s scalability or data consistency issues by just looking at the system architecture overview diagram.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thank you very much for your answers. I like the idea of putting a small ""cloud symbol"" on the traditional symbols.

I learned that when you do the normal View Source in Firefox, it takes the URL you're at and issues another GET request to that URL. There are two reasons why this is bad:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you've just issued a POST and do View Source, you won't see the HTML that your browser is actually rendering for you.</li>
<li>If the site author has incorrectly made a form that takes some action (sends email or writes to a DB or whatever), then that action will be taken (or attempted, anyway) again. That's sort of dangerous.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd heard there was something I could add to about:config that would prevent this, but had no luck. I also read about some extensions that would get around this, Firebug chief among them, but ctrl-shift-u is so convenient when compared to F12 and then a couple of clicks to find the element you're interested in.</p>

As often as not, it seems to actually be implemented with pseudo-logins for database roles; but that doesn't map usefully back to Windows permissions. Assuming single-login identity verification, why not just go with the simplest possible database roles?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <br />
So far we've picked up the single benefit that you don't need to store a password in your application; but that seems more like a trivial beneficial consequence than a design goal; there are lots of other more direct ways to achieve that, without closely coupling the entire security apparati of both universes.</p>

<p>EDIT AGAIN: <br />
Doesn't anyone else have any benefit to suggest, other than single login and ability for SD to maintain groups, thereby duplicating the capability for groups (based on the same user login) already existing in  SQL Server?</p>

<p>The group issue has several flaws, including the assumption that the AD manager is assumed to be equally qualified to maintain both; and it excludes any network connections that aren't part of AD (thereby locking you into MS technology.)</p>

My goal is to write script that will automatically perform some actions in the browser (on the client side – navigate to  page, perform actions, measure time between responses, etc.)</p>

<p>I have this little thing:</p>

<pre><code>$ie = new-object -com ""InternetExplorer.Application""
$ie.visible = $true
$ie.navigate(""http://google.com"")
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to check whether the browser stopped page rendering (assuming, that google takes like 30 seconds to load).
As I checked with <code>$ie | get-member</code> there is DocumentCompleted property (event), but I don’t know how to access/compare it.
How should I do that?</p>

<p>Or maybe I should use .NET instead COM object and initiate <code>$ie</code> with <code>[system.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser]</code> ?</p>

<p>cheers</p>

<p>edit:<br>
Well... <code>$ie.busy</code> works, but (what maybe I haven't made clear earlier) I want to know exact moment of the page rendering competition. Checking <code>$ie.busy</code> in infinite loop every second might work but I suppose it's not the best way to do that.</p>

<p>Let's say page is loading some time (rendering is long due to the gigantic scripts on client side). I would like how long does it take to:</p>

<ol>
<li>load page</li>
<li>how long it will take to reload/re-render after changing some data and clicking 'Save'.</li>

<p>The linq extension methods for ienumerable are very handy ... but not that useful if all you want to do is apply some computation to each item in the enumeration without returning anything.  So I was wondering if perhaps I was just missing the right method, or if it truly doesn't exist as I'd rather use a built-in version if it's available ... but I haven't found one :-)</p>

<p>I could have sworn there was a .ForEach method somewhere, but I have yet to find it.  In the meantime, I did write my own version in case it's useful for anyone else:</p>

<pre><code>using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public delegate void Function&lt;T&gt;(T item);
public delegate void Function(object item);

public static class EnumerableExtensions
{
    public static void For(this IEnumerable enumerable, Function func)
    {
        foreach (object item in enumerable)
        {
            func(item);
        }
    }

    public static void For&lt;T&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; enumerable, Function&lt;T&gt; func)
    {
        foreach (T item in enumerable)
        {
            func(item);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>usage is:</p>

<p><code>myEnumerable.For&lt;MyClass&gt;(delegate(MyClass item) { item.Count++; });</code></p>

<p>So I have two problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>The (abstract) Packet class would need to be copyable and assignable, but without slicing, keeping all the fields of the derived class. It may even be possible that the derived class will have no extra fields, only function, which would work with the array on the base class. How can I achieve that?</li>
<li>When serializing, I would give each sub-class an unique numeric ID, and then write it to the stream before the sub-class' own serialization. But for unserialization, how would I map the read ID to the appropriate sub-class to instanciate it?</li>

<p>Yes, I'm aware of the factory pattern, but how would I code it to construct each class? A giant switch statement? That would also duplicade the ID for each class (once in the factory and one in the serializator), which I'd like to avoid.</p>

Problem now I'm having is when I drag-n-drop items within or to another ListView control and I want to scroll up/down ""during"" the drag (moving an item from index 30 to index 1), it's not happening.  I would have to drag to the top of the visual items in the ListView, manually scroll up, then drag again, eventually ending at the position I want.  This isn't very user friendly.</p>

<p>Now I found the function (DragDropHelper.DropTarget_PreviewDragOver) that I would want to do the testing of which item is being dragged over, and I'm getting that.</p>

<pre><code>Dim pt As Point = e.GetPosition(DirectCast(Me.targetItemsControl, UIElement))

' Perform the hit test against a given portion of the visual object tree.
Dim result As HitTestResult = VisualTreeHelper.HitTest(Me.targetItemsControl, pt)
</code></pre>

<p>Now from there I can get the DependencyProperty of this visual hit</p>

<pre><code>Dim lvi As ListViewItem = TryCast(GetDependencyObjectFromVisualTree(TryCast(result.VisualHit, DependencyObject), GetType(ListViewItem)), ListViewItem)
</code></pre>

<p>Which is of a ListViewItem.  Now in the function DropTarget_PreviewDragOver I have the ""DraggedItem"" which is of type Picture in Bea's example, but that can change depending on the ObservableCollection you have bound to the ListView.  Now, I want to drag the ListView up or down depending on where the mouse is on the control.  I've attempted with the below un-finished non-working code</p>

<pre><code>If lvi IsNot Nothing Then
    If pt.Y &lt;= 25 Then
        Dim lv As ListView = TryCast(targetItemsControl, ListView)
        If lv IsNot Nothing Then
            Dim index As Integer = lv.Items.IndexOf(lvi)
            If index &gt; 1 Then
                lv.ScrollIntoView(lv.Items(index - 1))
            End If
        End If
    Else
        If pt.Y &gt;= Me.targetItemsControl.ActualHeight - 25 Then
            Debug.Print(""Scroll Down"")
        End If
    End If
End If

<p>I want to transform it with XSLT, but I want to suppress the second f2 element in the output - how do I check inside my template to see if the f2 element already exists in the output when the second f2 element in the source is processed? My XSLT looks something like this at present:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=""1.0"" xmlns:xsl=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform""&gt;
  &lt;xsl:output method=""xml"" indent=""no"" omit-xml-declaration=""yes"" standalone=""no"" /&gt;
  &lt;xsl:template match=""/""&gt;
    &lt;xsl:for-each select=""./root""&gt;
      &lt;output&gt;
        &lt;xsl:apply-templates /&gt;        
      &lt;/output&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
  &lt;xsl:template match=""*"" &gt;
      &lt;xsl:element name=""{name(.)}""&gt;
        &lt;xsl:value-of select=""."" /&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:element&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I need to do some sort of check around the xsl:element in the template I think, but I'm not sure how to interrogate the output document to see if the element is already present.</p>

All is fine until I want to run two (or more) instances of that service on a single machine.  Since the service name is hard coded into the program (via the Name property of the service), I can only install the service once on any given computer.  If I try to modify the Name property at run-time, the service does not respond unless the Name property is set to the same thing that was set during design time.</p>

<p>I have done a workaround for this where I have all of the code that is not interacting directly with the service control manager encapsulated out into separate unit(s).  Then I write a separate Delphi project for each instance that I want of the service that has just enough code to launch itself and start running the main code.</p>

<p>This method is, in my opinion, ugly and is certainly inefficient.  It works okay for two instances, but then we need a third and a fourth and ...</p>

<p>Is there any way that I can modify my code so that I have just one Delphi project that can install and run itself as multiple service instances with some simple run-time input (e.g. command line flag)?</p>

The only Oracle libraries that should be found in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH that jboss is started with are libocijdbc10.so libclntsh.so.10.1 and libnnz10.so.  These three libraries and the jboss server itself are in source control, so they are the same versions on both CompB and CompC.</p>

<p>CompB can connect, using OCI and thin, to both CompA and CompB.  CompC cannot connect using OCI, but can connect using thin, to both CompA and CompB, so it shouldn't be a server version issue.</p>

<p>Both CompB and CompC are running 32-bit Ubuntu 8.04, though CompC has a slightly slower CPU and only 1GB of RAM, compared to 3.25GB RAM on CompB.</p>

<p>Now I have to prove that it is tightly bound, that is Big theta.</p>

<p>I've read that nested <code>for</code> loops have Big O of <code>n^2</code>.  Is this also true for Big Theta?  If not how would I go about finding Big Theta?!</p>

<p>**C1= C sub 1, C2= C sub 2, and no= n naught all are elements of positive real numbers</p>

<p>To find the <code>T(n)</code> I looked at the values of <code>j</code> and looked at how many times the while loop executed:</p>

<pre><code>values of J:   2, 3, 4, ... n  
Loop executes: 1, 2, 3, ... n
</code></pre>

<p>Analysis:<br>
Take the summation of the while loop executions and recognize that it is <code>(n(n+1))/2</code>
I will assign this as my <code>T(n)</code> and prove it is tightly bounded by <code>n^2</code>. 
That is <code>n(n+1)/2= θ(n^2)</code></p>

<p>Scratch Work:</p>

<pre><code>Find C1, C2, no є R+ such that 0 ≤ C1(n^2) ≤ (n(n+1))/2 ≤ C2(n^2)for all n ≥ no

To make 0 ≤ C1(n) true, C1, no, can be any positive reals   
To make C1(n^2) ≤ (n(n+1))/2, C1 must be ≤ 1  
To make (n(n+1))/2 ≤ C2(n^2), C2 must be ≥ 1  
</code></pre>

<p>PF:</p>

<pre><code>Find C1, C2, no є R+ such that 0 ≤ C1(n^2) ≤ (n(n+1))/2 ≤ C2(n^2) for all n ≥ no
Let C1= 1/2, C2= 1 and no = 1.  
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>show that 0 ≤ C1(n^2) is true
C1(n^2)= n^2/2<br>
     n^2/2≥ no^2/2<br>
     ⇒no^2/2≥ 0<br>
     1/2  > 0<br>
Therefore C1(n^2) ≥ 0 is proven true!  </p></li>
<li><p>show that C1(n^2) ≤ (n(n+1))/2  is true
C1(n^2) ≤ (n(n+1))/2<br>
n^2/2  ≤ (n(n+1))/2
n^2 ≤ n(n+1)<br>
n^2 ≤ n^2+n<br>
0 ≤ n  </p>

<p>This we know is true since n ≥ no = 1<br>
Therefore C1(n^2) ≤ (n(n+1))/2  is proven true!  </p></li>
<li><p>Show that (n(n+1))/2 ≤ C2(n^2) is true
(n(n+1))/2 ≤ C2(n^2)<br>
(n+1)/2 ≤ C2(n)<br>
n+1 ≤ 2 C2(n)<br>
n+1 ≤ 2(n)<br>
1 ≤ 2n-n<br>
1 ≤ n(2-1) = n<br>
1≤ n<br>
Also, we know this to be true since n ≥ no = 1  </p>

<p>Hence by 1, 2 and 3, θ(n^2 )= (n(n+1))/2 is true since<br>
0 ≤ C1(n^2) ≤ (n(n+1))/2 ≤ C2(n^2) for all n ≥ no   </p></li>
</ol>

<p>For clarification, what I am trying to do is hook up WPF sliders to a WinForms User Control. Currently in my app I have a ValueChanged event handler that passes the slider value to the WinForms control via a method call. The WinForms control (which is actually a wrapper around a native OpenGL window) needs to be able to dynamically change the slider based on it's internal calculations. To do this I use an abstraction of a slider (ISlider) , I instantiate a WPF-flavor of that slider in my app, and pass a handle to it's base to the WinForms control via a .NET property on the WinForms User Control. All of this is currently working, it's just that when the internal logic decides the slider needs to change, it calls ISlider::SetPos(), which then changes the WPF slider, which then triggers a ValueChanged event on the slider, and the handler for that event extracts the slider's position and passes it in to the WinForms control which originated the event in the first place. The suggestions by ligaz and Alan Le both seem like they should work, but I'm just not sure I'm going about this in the best way.</p>

<li>Allows for constraints on numbers.  Something like '/cal/long/3/4/143:#>100&amp;&lt;1110' to specify that a string prefix with '/cal/long/3/4/143:' and then a number between (100,1110) is expected.</li>

<p>Below is the excel sheet data that is read in. Data is filled into the occurence column for the <strong>left half</strong> of the table.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.dipzo.com/initial.PNG"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tDJBi.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tDJBi.png"" width=""620""></a><br>
<sub>(source: <a href=""http://www.dipzo.com/initial.PNG"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dipzo.com</a>)</sub>  </a></p>

<p>The VB6 Application then read this data into a multi dimensional array which is then fed into a MSFlexGrid object.
Here is the code to do that:</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub GridSort(temp() As String)
fgData.Rows = UBound(temp)
x = 0
 Do While x &lt; fgData.Rows
    fgData.Row = x
    fgData.Col = 0
    fgData.Text = temp(x, 0)
    fgData.Col = 1
    fgData.Text = temp(x, 1)
    x = x + 1
  Loop
  fgData.ColSel = 1
  fgData.Sort = flexSortGenericDescending
  x = 0
  Do While x &lt; fgData.Rows
    fgData.Row = x
    fgData.Col = 0
    temp(x, 0) = fgData.Text
    fgData.Col = 1
    temp(x, 1) = fgData.Text
    x = x + 1
  Loop

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Now this works to a degree. It sorts the Data by occurences and outputs as so:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.dipzo.com/end.PNG"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vqiED.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vqiED.png"" width=""620""></a><br>
<sub>(source: <a href=""http://www.dipzo.com/end.PNG"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dipzo.com</a>)</sub>  </a></p>

<p>However, you can see that it messed up the order of the first column. I want the data to be sorted by occurences first, but for data with the same amount of occurences, I want them sorted by operation. Does anybody know a way to accomplish this?</p>

<p>I'm not doing anything fancy, simply loading (via MAMP) the page, 
<a href=""http://localhost:8888/MAMP/lynn/setcookie.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://localhost:8888/MAMP/lynn/setcookie.php</a></p>

<p>That script has the setcookie code at the top, prior to even writing the HTML tags. (although I tried it in the BODY as well). I load the page in various browsers, then open the cookie listing. I know the browsers accept cookies, because I see current ones in the list. Just not my new one.</p>

"558853","1","558874","","2009-02-17 21:43:35","","3","6369","<p>I have an object, a Timeline, that encapsulates a thread. Events can be scheduled on the timeline; the thread will wait until it is time to execute any event, execute it, and go back to sleep (for either (a) the time it takes to get to the next event or (b) indefinitely if there are no more events).</p>

<p>The sleeping is handled with a WaitEventHandle, which is triggered when the list of event is altered (because the sleep delay may need to be adjusted) or when the thread should be stopped (so the thread can terminate gracefully).</p>

<p>The destructor calls Stop(), and I've even implemented IDisposable and Dispose() also calls Stop().</p>

<p>Still, when I use this component in a forms application, my application will never shut down properly when I close the form. For some reason, Stop() is never called, so neither my object's destructor triggers, nor is the Dispose() method called, <em>before</em> .NET decides to wait for all threads to finish.</p>

<p>I suppose the solution would be to explicitly call Dispose() myself on the FormClose event, but since this class is going to be in a library, <em>and</em> it is actually a layer deeper (that is, the application developer will never actually see the Timeline class), this seems very ugly and an extra (unnecessary) gotcha for the application developer. The using() clause, which I would normally use when resource release becomes an issue, doesn't apply as this is going to be a long-lived object.</p>

<p>On the one hand, I can understand that .NET will want to wait for all threads to finish before it does its final round of garbage collection, but in this case that produces a very clumsy situation.</p>

<p>How can I make my thread clean up after itself properly without adding requirements to consumers of my library? Put another way, how can I make .NET notify my object when the application is exiting, but before it will wait for all threads to finish?</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: In response to the people saying that it is ok for the client program to be aware of the thread: I respectfully disagree.</p>

<p>As I said in my original post, the thread is hidden away in another object (an Animator). I instantiate an Animator for another object, and I tell it to perform animations, such as ""blink this light for 800ms"". </p>

<p>As a consumer of the Animator object, I do not care how the Animator makes sure that the light blinks for exactly 800ms. Does it start a thread? I don't care. Does it create a hidden window and use system timers (ew)? I don't care. Does it hire midgets to turn my light on and off? I don't care.</p>

<p>And I <em>especially</em> don't want to have to care that if I ever create an Animator, I have to  keep track of it and call a special method when my program exits, in contrast to every other object. It should be a concern of the library implementor, not the library consumer.</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice!

</ul>

<p>In Visual C# 2008 Express, I can ""Add Item"" and create a ""Local Database"" (.sdf file) or a ""Service Based Database"" (.mdf file).</p>

<p>Visual Studio 2008 is the same as Visual C# 2008 for applications but in Websites, the only way I can create .sdf or .mdf files is via the Database Explorer.</p>

<p>In Visual Web Developer 2008 Express, however, I can ""Add Item"" and ONLY create a ""SQL Server Database"" (.mdf file). Even the Database Explorer doesn't offer to create a SQL CE database.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>why the discrepency between the applications, is this normal or did something go wrong with my installations?</li>
<li>I never ""installed SQL CE"", where did it come from and how is it that I am able to create .sdf file?</li>
<li>How do you work with these in projects on a day to day basis, do you use Visual Studio to edit the databases or do you use SQL Server Management Studio?</li>

if ( a &amp;&amp; b ) { ... };
</code></pre>

<p>In most languages, <code>b</code> will not get evaluated because <code>a</code> is false so <code>a &amp;&amp; b</code> cannot be true. My question is, wouldn't short circuiting be slower in terms of architecture? In a pipeline, do you just stall while waiting to get the result of a to determine if b should be evaluated or not? Would it be better to do nested ifs instead? Does that even help?</p>

<p>Also, does anyone know what short-circuit evaluation is typically called? This question arose after I found out that my programming friend had never heard of short-circuit evaluation and stated that it is not common, nor found in many languages, and is inefficient in pipeline. I am not certain about the last one, so asking you folks!</p>

<p>Okay, I think a different example to perhaps explain where my friend might be coming from. He believes that since evaluating a statement like the following in parallel:</p>

<pre><code>(a) if ( ( a != null ) &amp;&amp; ( a.equals(b) ) ) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>will crash the system, an architecture that doesn't have short-circuiting (and thereby not allowing statements like the above) would be faster in processing statements like these:</p>

<pre><code>(b) if ( ( a == 4 ) &amp;&amp; ( b == 5 ) )
</code></pre>

<p>since if it couldn't do (a) in parallel, it can't do (b) in parallel. In this case, a language that allows short-circuiting is slower than one that does not.</p>

<p>I don't know if that's true or not.</p>

"389451","1","389479","","2008-12-23 17:06:39","","4","6382","<p>I have a page in my application that refreshes some content (a list of users currently signed in) from the server every 10 seconds. This data is loaded using the <a href=""http://docs111.mootools.net/Remote/Ajax.js"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ajax</a> class from the <a href=""http://docs111.mootools.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mootools framework</a>, specifically with Javascript that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>var xmldata = (function() {
    new Ajax('xmldata.jsp?time='+$time(), {method: 'get', onComplete: dataLoaded, autoCancel: true}).request();
}).periodical(10000);
</code></pre>

<p>(which, every 10 seconds, creates an <code>Ajax</code> object and calls it's <code>request()</code> method, which will invoke <code>dataLoaded()</code> method when complete).</p>

<p>If a user leaves their browser window open to this page for about 45-60 minutes, then attempting to navigate elsewhere will cause IE (v7 for sure, v6 as well I believe, Firefox or Chrome do not have this issue) to display the following popup:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stop running this script?<br>
  A script on this page is causing Internet Explorer to run slowly.
  If it continues to run, your computer may become unresponsive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, it seems to me that this is likely caused by some sort of leak in the underlying script in the mootools framework - either too many <code>Ajax.request()</code> calls are queuing up to be called or some objects are not being properly cleaned up, even though the framework is supposed to have some garbage collection features in it.</p>

<p>What are the best ways to analyze what IE's Javascript engine has done under the covers? Is there any possible way to determine if either of my hypothesis' are correct?</p>

<p>I've seen that in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/212550/a-script-on-this-page-is-causing-ie-to-run-slowly"">a similar question</a>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/212550/a-script-on-this-page-is-causing-ie-to-run-slowly#214244"">someone suggested</a> using IBM Page Profiler to debug this issue. I've tried using Page Profiler and haven't had much success - it seems to be useful if you are having a problem with the initial load of a page (to analyze what component is causing an excessive loading delay) but it does not seem to be able to analyze what goes on with Javascript running within a page <em>after</em> it has been completely loaded. I see in Page Profiler that the async calls to xmldata.jsp are requested every 10 seconds, but Page Profiler only shows that the server responds ok (in about 600 ms) but has no insight into how the parent page's script uses this data.</p>

<p>In addition, <a href=""http://n2.nabble.com/IE.-Stop-running-this-script-popup-error---mootools-1.11-td1572531.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in this post</a> on the since-closed mootools discussion list, someone suggests removing code that registers an <code>unload</code> listener to call a garbage-collection method to resolve this issue - but that seems like resolving a symptom of the problem and not the problem itself.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>I'm trying to find a way to attach some custom value (basically timestamp) to the message published by producers, so that I may able to consume message for a specific time duration. Right now Kafka only make sure that the message will be delivered in a order they were put in the queue. But in my case a previously generated record might arrive after a certain delay( so a message generated at time T1 might have a higher offset 1 than another generated at later time T2 with offset 0). For this reason they will not be in the order I expect at the consumer's end. So I am basically looking for a way out to consume them in a ordered way.</p>

<p>The current Kafka 0.8 release provides no way to attach anything other than the ""Message Key"" at the producer end, found a similar topic <a href=""http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/kafka-users/201304.mbox/%3CCAFbh0Q3GzgCQt-CSVt3Ui_qkNBSiLhbC=sGcPnq2w+LgiAd7vA@mail.gmail.com%3E"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> where it was advised to encode the same in the message payload. But I did a lot of searching but couldn't find a possible approach. </p>

<p>Also I don't know if such approach have any impact on the overall performance of Kafka as it manages the message offset internally and there are no such API exposed so far as can be seen from <a href=""https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/A+Guide+To+The+Kafka+Protocol#AGuideToTheKafkaProtocol-OffsetCommitRequest"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> page</p>

I'm also new to C# and LINQ (just to complicate things further.)</p>

<p>I believe I have the data model suitably normalised but I may be wrong. Visual Studio generates a conceptual model that looks OK. I've pluralised the associations and EntitySets where necessary, but I'm struggling to perform what I think is a fairly basic query/projection on the data.</p>

<p>The database contains 3 tables:</p>

<pre><code>[Server]    - A server defined by the user that should be pinged.
ServerID    - primary key
HostAddress - IP or hostname

[Result]    - A result containing data about the last server test
ResultID    - primary key
ServerID    - foreign key on [Server].[ServerID]
StateID     - an integer used to lookup one of 3 possible Server states
TimeStamp   - Time stamp of last ping

[State]     - A lookup table containing an integer -&gt; string mapping.
StateID     - a unique key
StateLabel  - human-readable string like ""unreachable"" or ""OK"" or ""timeout""
</code></pre>

<p>I have manually populated the database using a few simple entries - just enough to give me something to work with. </p>

<p>For starters, I would like to present all of the Result data in a ListView on a WinForm. The ListView contains the following static columns:</p>

<p>State | Server Address | Last checked</p>

<p>In theory, the ListView's data needs to be generated by projecting(?) across each of the 3 tables:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ""State"" column should display the human-readable [State].[StateLabel] linked from [Result].[StateID]</li>
<li>The ""Server Address"" column should display [Server].[HostAddress] linked from [Result].[ServerID]</li>
<li>The ""Last Checked"" column should display [Result].[TimeStamp]</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Since I have no need for the object materialisation and/or change-tracking features of ObjectServices, am I correct in thinking it would be more efficient/correct to use Entity SQL/EntityClient and DbDataReader? If so, what would a suitable Entity SQL query look like?</strong></p>

         where s.StateId == r.StateId
         select s.StateLabel),
    r.ServerReference.Value.HostAddress,
    r.TimeStamp
};

return results.ToList(); // &lt;- No can do.

<p>The static library I'm writing is dependant on libxml2.  libxml2 has a dynamic library (dylib) and a static library (a).  I've tried two approaches.</p>

<p>Approach one - When I attempt to link against the static library by adding ""-lxml2"" to ""Other linker flags"" the build fails with the following message:</p>

<pre><code>/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/bin/libtool: file: -lxml2 is not an object file (not allowed in a library)

<p>Approach two - I can successfully link against the dynamic library from my static library but I'm not sure if this is allowed (or the proper approach) on the iPhone.  Even though I'm building a static library, does Apple allow static libraries that link against dynamic libraries?  I'm still learning about static libraries, but from my understanding the code from the dylib would be combined with my code to make one library, thus linking against the dylib shouldn't be an issue.</p>

<p>I've tried several different methods (many of them mentioned in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/320677/how-do-i-set-the-icon-for-my-application-in-visual-studio-2008"">this other question</a>), but I am still having some strange issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When including an icon as a resource, it does show up as the executable file's icon immediately, but for the icon to show up on the taskbar, I have to restart the computer.  Until then, it continues to show up as whatever the previous icon was.  Cleaning the solution, restarting VS, doesn't have any effect.  Not a really big issue, as it won't affect a released exe, but it would be nice to know where it's keeping the old icon cached and how to get rid of it.</p></li>
<li><p>No matter what I do, the icon displayed when alt-tabbing is the default app icon (square and white and generic).  This includes embedding the icon in the executable, as well as setting <code>ICON_BIG</code> with <code>WM_SETICON</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As for the second matter, my code looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>   hIcon = (HICON)(
      LoadImage( NULL, szFilename, IMAGE_ICON, 32, 32, LR_LOADFROMFILE ) );
   if( hIcon )
      SendMessage( hWnd, WM_SETICON, ICON_BIG, (LPARAM)hIcon );
</code></pre>

<p>However, after sending <code>WM_SETICON</code>, <code>GetLastError()</code> returns 6, ""The handle is invalid."".  <code>hWnd</code> is a valid window handle, and <code>hIcon</code> appears to be a valid icon handle.  I've tried searching for reasons why <code>WM_SETICON</code> could cause that error, and at the very least, to figure out WHICH handle it thinks is invalid, but no luck yet.  I've cleared the error code immediately before calling <code>SendMessage()</code>, so it has to be set somewhere in the processing of the message.</p>

<p>I tried an alternate method, loading the icon from the exe itself, where the ID of the resource is <code>101</code> (it's the first and only resource included):</p>

<pre><code>   hIcon = (HICON)(
      LoadImage( GetModuleHandle( NULL ), MAKEINTRESOURCE( 101 ),
      IMAGE_ICON, 48, 48, 0 ) );
   if( hIcon )
      SendMessage( hWnd, WM_SETICON, ICON_BIG, (LPARAM)hIcon );
</code></pre>

<p>... but the same thing happens; after calling <code>SendMessage()</code>, <code>GetLastError()</code> gives the same error status.</p>

<p>I've tried different dimensions (such as 48x48, all of which are present in the icon file), but to no different effect.  I know it's definitely finding and loading the images, because if I specify a size that doesn't exist or an invalid resource ID or the wrong filename (depending on how I am loading it), it fails out long before <code>SendMessage()</code>.</p>

<p>Strangely, if I specify <code>ICON_SMALL</code> instead of <code>ICON_BIG</code>, the call succeeds with no error status, but from <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms632643.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the docs</a>, I need to use <code>ICON_BIG</code> to set the icon used while alt-tabbing.  Also, if I use <code>ICON_BIG</code> but load the 16x16 icon, I get no error status, but nothing changes.</p>

<p>Any ideas about what could be causing <code>WM_SETICON</code> to fail?  Anything terribly wrong with any of the code I've posted (aside from formatting/style/casting issues, as it's simplified to just the basics)?</p>

<p>I'm currently developing a web application and I'm curious as to why most websites don't mind displaying their exact server configuration in HTTP headers, like versions of Apache and PHP, with complete ""mod_perl, mod_python, ..."" listing and so on.</p>

<p>From a security point of view, I'd prefer that it would be impossible to find out if I'm running PHP on Apache, ASP.NET on IIS or even Rails on Lighttpd.</p>

<p>Obviously ""obscurity is not security"" but should I be worried at all that visitors know what version of Apache and PHP my server is running ? Is it good practice or totally unnecessary to hide this information ?</p>

My current code looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>bool collectionModified = false;
if(collectionNeedsModification)
{
    modifyCollection();
    collectionModified = true;
}

var aggregationResult = from a in
                            (from b in collection
                             where b.SatisfysCondition)
                             .Aggregate(aggregationFunction)
                        select a.NeededValue;

if(collectionModified)
    modifyCollection();

return aggregationResult;
</code></pre>

<p>However, as written, if I modify the collection, I will get the wrong result because I'm putting the collection back in its original state before <code>aggregationResult</code> is enumerated and LINQ results are lazy-evaluated. My current solution is to use <code>.ToArray()</code> on my LINQ query like this:</p>

<pre><code>var aggregationResult = (from a in
                            (from b in collection
                             where b.SatisfysCondition)
                             .Aggregate(aggregationFunction)
                         select a.NeededValue).ToArray();
</code></pre>

<p>The size of the resulting array will always be small (&lt; 100 items) so memory / processing time is not a concern.  Is this the best way to handle my problem, or is there a better way to force the evaluation of a LINQ query?</p>

<p>Now, I want to pick the next scheduled slave in a round-robin scheduling scheme, with a twist. I have a ""request mask"" which says which slaves actually want to be scheduled. The next slave will be picked only from those that want to.</p>

<p>Some examples (assume round-robin scheduling is done by rotating left). 
Example1:</p>

<ul>
<li>Current: ""00000100""</li>
<li>Mask: ""01100000""</li>
<li>Next schedule: ""00100000"" - in normal round-robin, #3 and then #4 should come after #2, but they don't request, so #5 is picked.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example2:</p>

<ul>
<li>Current: ""01000000""</li>
<li>Mask: ""00001010""</li>
<li>Next: ""00000010"" - because scheduling is done by cycling left, and #1 is the first requesting slave in that order.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Now, this can be easily coded in a loop, I know. But I actually want to get my result by a bit-twiddling operation, without loops. The motivation: I want to implement this in hardware (in an FPGA) in VHDL/Verilog.</p>

<p>A bonus is to make up an algorithm that's generic for any amount of slaves N.</p>

<p>By the way, this is not a homework question. It's an important problem whenever one wants to schedule slaves in some manner, and condition the scheduling by the slaves' requests. My current solution is somewhat ""heavy"" and I wanted to know if I'm missing something obvious.</p>

<p>EDIT: Here's an example. If I turn off the outgoing SMTP server on my XP computer and then run an application that sends a dozen emails, they get queued up somewhere, since the .NET SMTPClient.Send call succeeds. A few hours later, I start the local SMTP server, and the mail leaves in a sudden flurry. Where is it in the meantime? The same behavior happens on my Vista desktop, though I have no local SMTP server - I can duplicate the functionality by blocking port 25 on the firewall, and then mail queues up somewhere. Where?</p>

<p>The reason for this question is that I want to re-enable the SMTP Service on a server I have, but I don't know what's been queued up in the meantime, and I want to make sure the queue is clean when I re-enable the service. That way, customers don't get really, really old queued emails all of the sudden.</p>

    s.Send(mm)
</code></pre>

<p>I get an exception because I don't have an IIS pickup folder. Changing it to ""Mail.SmtpDeliveryMethod.Network"" results in an immediate exception because I don't have an SMTP server running. I'll test this on server 2003, but I could have sworn that these both worked in the past. I'll do some more testing and modify the question if needed.</p>

<p>I'm developing a Memory Management module for my company. We develop games for next-gen consoles (Xbox 360, PS3 and PC... we consider PC a console!).</p>

<p>We'll need in future, for our next games, to handle texture streaming for large game worlds that cannot be loaded all in main console memory (not talking about PC for now).</p>

<p>We are going to stream at the beginning hi-res mipmaps of textures (that is about 70% of the size of world data). Maybe in the future we'll have to stream also geometry, smaller mipmaps, audio, etc.</p>

<p>I'm developing a Memory Manager for that issue, focused on X360 (because over PS3 we can use host memory and the associated, auto-defragmenting GMM allocator).</p>

<p>The problem I'm facing is the following: We have decided to reserve a specific Memory Area for texture streaming (for example 64 Megabytes) and we want to handle all allocations and deallocations in that area. We have allocated the area at the beginning of the application and the area is Physically guaranteed to be contiguous (not just virtually, cause we need to store textures there).</p>

<p>I've implemented an auto defragmenting allocator, using handles instead of pointers. Time is not an issue, the problem is memory fragmentation. In game we continuously load and unload streaming targets, so we'd like to use the maximum amount of our buffer (64 Megabytes).</p>

<p>With this allocator we can use all of the allocated space but the defragmentation routine works in an unaccettable time (sometimes 60 milliseconds, more than a frames!) while the algorithm is not too bad... there are just too meny unevitable memcpy!</p>

<p>I'm looking for a solution to solve this issue. I'd like to find at least a good paper, or a post-mortem, or someone who have faced the same problem of mine.</p>

<p>Now I'm choosing between two strategies:
1) move the defragmentation routine on a dedicated thread (good for X360 with 6 hw threads, bad for PS3 with just a hw thread... and don't tell me to use SPU's!) with all multithreading problems of locking regions, of accessing a region who is being moved,...
2) find an ""incremental"" solution to defragmentation problem: we can give each frame a time budget (for example up to 1 millisecond) for defragmentation and the Memory Manager will do what it can do in the budget each frame.</p>

<p>Can someone tell me his experience about?</p>

<p>I need to place an Infragistics web grid into either a div or a table cell. The grid must size to fit the div or cell. If there is too much data to display, I need the grid to do its magic and add its own scrollbars.</p>

<p>So far I have achieved this using javascript and resizeing every time the browser window resizes. Unfortunately when refreshing the page (using AJAX), the grids resize themselves to their default sizes for a second before correcting but this is not acceptable to the customer (or me for that matter).</p>

<p>It is irritating that width=100% works but height=100% does not. I find that it just extends out of the div or table (not even resizing the div, just expanding out of it).</p>

<p>I have tried the KB article that sets the height and width to 100% and the frame custom rules to table-layout:auto but this doesn't work.</p>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>I created a test project with a 500px tall table, two rows (each 50% height) and two cells per row to give a 2 x 2 grid. If I set the Infragistics grid height to 100% within a cell, it fits perfectly until you bind it to data. It then extends, making the table more than 500px high.</p>

<p>I tried putting a 100% x 100% div in one of the cells and the grid in this. Then the table stays the correct size but the grid grows in height by the size of a row and extends out of the div and the cell :-(</p>

<p>I am starting to wonder if the Infragistics web controls are as good as they should be. They certainly don't seem to be as good as the Windows versions.</p>

Users viewed this data primarily through an intranet web interface.  Instead of having a table of user accounts, each user account was a real first-class account in the RDBMS, which permitted them to connect with their own query tools, etc., as well as permitting us to control access through the RDBMS itself instead of using our own application logic.</p>

<p>Is this a good setup, assuming you're not on the public intranet and dealing with potentially millions of (potentially malicious) users or something?  Or is it always better to define your own means of handling user accounts, your own permissions, your own application security logic, and only hand out RDBMS accounts to power users with special needs?</p>

Suppose it's deep, and there's lots of virtual functions and possibly even multiple inheritance as well. (Yes, a bit of a maintenance nightmare). Any attempt to refactor this class hierarchy into something saner will need to know which implementation of each virtual function each class uses.</p>

<p>If we take an arbitrary leaf class L1 - which derives from base class B1, which derives from base class B2, etc. - it will clearly have a vtable for the class which will show something like (pseudo-vtable):</p>

<pre><code>L1::F1
B3::F2
B1::F3
L1::F4
etc.
</code></pre>

<p>...depending on exactly which virtual functions have been overridden by which class.</p>

<p>How could one see such a vtable in a form much like that? It would be possible to reconstruct it by hand by reading through the code, but that's error-prone and laborious. Presumably also, breaking into an object of the class in the debugger could allow you to inspect the vtable in a Watch window via the vtable pointer for that one class, but that's an awkward solution particularly if you want to also see the vtables for L2, L3, ... LN.</p>

<p><a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/jasonz/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jason Zander</a> of the Visual Studio development team, at the time, replied <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/jasonz/archive/2004/01/31/65653.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">with his views on the topic</a>, arguing that the topic is somewhat moot - the ability to fix security problems in the runtime (among other points) was their chief concern.  Overall, the small overhead was worth it.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2009.  There's a few groups out there now claiming to have C# linkers.  (Jason Zander even said himself that it wouldn't take much to implement one.)  Instead of the cute, dozen-so meg download of .NET 1.0, we now have a massive 200-300 mb cross-platform complete .NET 3.5 installer that contains versions of .NET for x86, x64, and ia64.  Microsoft's suggestions to decrease the runtime size include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unpack the redistributable, remove the target platforms you don't want, and put it back together</li>
<li>Use the web bootstrapper that only downloads the libraries for your platform</li>
<li>Use the Client Profile installer (new as of late 2008) which has limited libraries and only works for x86</li>
</ul>

<p>To make matters worse, as I understand it (please correct me if I'm wrong) the client profile don't even register with windows as having .NET 3.5 installed.  This means if multiple .NET 3.5 client applications are installed on the computer, none will see each other and the runtime will be re-installed again and again!</p>

<p>I really don't know what Microsoft is thinking here.  Even assuming the worst case install will be for one target platform (eg, x64) and only those libraries need to be included, you're still looking at upwards of 60 mb overhead on your app.  Even one of the most well known .NET apps, Paint.NET, was fraught with <a href=""http://blog.getpaint.net/2008/08/24/the-paintnet-install-experience-part-1-version-3xx/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Difficulties installing the application because of the massive .NET dependencies.</a>  If THEY have problems distributing a free app, what about the rest of the world?  In the end, they had to <a href=""http://blog.getpaint.net/2008/08/25/the-paintnet-install-experience-part-2-version-40/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Make a bootstrapper that installed Microsoft Installer 3.1, the .NET runtime bootstrapper, and all their other dependent libraires</a> before they could install their own application.</p>

<p>So how about it.  A linker.  Do any good ones exist - or a tool that simply makes it possible to build a C# application without requiring that the user install the massive .NET runtime?</p>

<p>Update: so, it looks like there's a couple of options:</p>

<p>Mono:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/Linker"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mono has its own linker</a>.  From the answer below, it looks like it works pretty well.</li>
</ul>

<p>.NET:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.xenocode.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Xenocode</a> seems to be one that's available and works.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.thinstall.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Thinstall</a> is another that was recommended, and it's by VMware.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.remotesoft.com/linker/"" rel=""noreferrer"">There's another linker by Remotesoft</a>.  They bill it as an 'obfuscator'.  Any thoughts there?</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.skaterpro.net/linking-net-dlls.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Found another by Rustemsoft called Skater .NET Obfuscator</a>.  Anyone familiar with them?</li>
<li><a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mbarnett/ILMerge.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">ILmerge by Microsoft was also suggested</a>; this looks like it only performs part of the task (ie, merging libraries, not stripping out unused bits).</li>
</ul>

<p>It looks like the Mono tools are getting use; how about the .NET based tools?  Any other experience with them, or are we just going to have to wait for Microsoft to push it 3.5 out to everyone?  I shudder to think how long it'll take for .NET 4.0 to be put out...</p>

<ol>
<li>All <code>Car</code>s have an <code>Engine</code>.  Further, a <code>FooCar</code> will only ever use a <code>FooEngine</code>.</li>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Based on the answers given so far, I'm leaning towards two possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have <code>Car</code> provide a pure virtual <code>getEngine()</code> function.  That would allow <code>FooCar</code> and <code>BarCar</code> to have implementations that return the correct kind of <code>Engine</code>.</li>
<li>Absorb all of the <code>Engine</code> functionality into the <code>Car</code> inheritance tree.  <code>Engine</code> was broken out for maintenance reasons (to keep the <code>Engine</code> stuff in a separate place).  It's a trade-off between having more small classes (small in lines of code) versus having fewer large classes.</li>

<p>I found this very old post (<a href=""https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/333/how-to-dynamically-refresh-reload-a-kml-layer-in-openlayers"">https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/333/how-to-dynamically-refresh-reload-a-kml-layer-in-openlayers</a>) for KML layers, but it appears to use variables no longer found in OL3 and I am not sure that it would allow for only loading files that have been modified since the last load. At first glance it appears that a full reload is forced, even if the file has not been modified.</p>

<p>There does not seem to be anything in the API that resembles a reload function for the map or layer objects in OL3. Is there a way to do this?</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong></p>

<p>I found a possible way to do this as an answer in this question: <a href=""https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/125074/openlayers3-how-to-reload-a-layer-from-geoserver-when-underlying-data-change"">https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/125074/openlayers3-how-to-reload-a-layer-from-geoserver-when-underlying-data-change</a> using the code:</p>

<pre><code>layer.getSource().updateParams({""time"": Date.now()});
</code></pre>

<p>however when I run this code I get the error:</p>

<pre><code>TypeError: selectedLayer.getSource(...).updateParams is not a function
</code></pre>

<p>Upon checking the API Reference for OL3 it appears that no such functions exist. The closest is setProperties() or setAttributions(). Neither of which work. It also appears that not all layer types implement getSource().</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>The refresh() reloads the tiles, but does not appear to be requesting them from the server. Rather, it appears they are being loaded from a cache (but not the HTTP cache). No requests are made, no HTTP 304s or anything like that. Will be trying a variant of the KML approach and posting the results soon.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong></p>

<p>After trying LOTS of different solutions I accidentally stumbled upon something that worked for vector layers. By calling the layer source.clear() function and then calling Map.updateSize(), the layer is automagically reloaded from it's source URL. An XHR GET request is issued and if the source file has changed, it will be reloaded from the file. If the source file has not changed, a 304 will be issued and the source will be reloaded from the cache.</p>

<p>Below is a function that should uses this method to reload a given layer:</p>

<pre><code>function refreshLayer(selectedLayer)
{
    var selectedLayerSource = selectedLayer.getSource();

    if(selectedLayerSource instanceof ol.source.Vector)
    {
        //do vector reload
        selectedLayerSource.clear();
        map.updateSize();
    }
    else
    {
        //reload the entire page
        window.location.reload();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, it appears that on the first few tries (depending on the browser) the request is sent, a 200 code is sent back, but the layer does not reflect any changes. After a few tries (and reloading the page a few times) it works. Once it starts working for a layer it continues to work as often as the source file is changed. Does anyone have any idea what is going on?</p>

<p><strong>Update 4:</strong></p>

<p>Using an adaptation of Jonatas' answer I am getting better results. New features pop up instantly on a reload. However, old features are not removed from the map and many features that have moved locations are shown on the map twice. Below is my code:</p>

<pre><code>function refreshSelectedLayer()
{
    console.log(""This feature is still in the process of being implemented. Refresh may not actually occur."");

    var selectedLayerSource = selectedLayer.getSource();

    if(selectedLayerSource instanceof ol.source.Vector)
    {
        var now = Date.now();
        var format = selectedLayerSource.getFormat();
        var url = selectedLayerSource.getUrl();
        url = url + '?t=' + now;

        loader = ol.featureloader.xhr(url, format);

        selectedLayerSource.clear();
        loader.call(selectedLayerSource, [], 1, 'EPSG:3857');

        map.updateSize();
    }
    else if(selectedLayerSource instanceof ol.source.Tile)
    {
        selectedLayerSource.changed();
        selectedLayerSource.refresh();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the var selectedLayer is set elsewhere in the code. Any ideas why these very odd results are occuring?</p>

<p><strong>Update 5:</strong></p>

<p>I noticed that if I remove all other code besides the:</p>

<pre><code>source.clear();
</code></pre>

<p>call an XHR GET request is made and the features do not disappear. Why is clearing the source not removing all of the features?</p>

<p><strong>Update 6:</strong></p>

<p>After discovering that ol.source.clear() was not actually removing features from a given data source/layer I replaced it using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>selectedLayerSource.forEachFeature(function(feature){
        selectedLayerSource.removeFeature(feature);
    });
</code></pre>

<p>By outputting the features in the layer before and after each step, I got this:</p>

<pre><code>var now = Date.now();
    var format = selectedLayerSource.getFormat();
    var url = selectedLayerSource.getUrl();
    url = url + '?t=' + now;

    console.log(""time: ""+now+""  format: ""+format+""  url: ""+url);

    loader = ol.featureloader.xhr(url, format);

    console.log(selectedLayerSource.getFeatures());
    console.log(""Deleting features..."");

    /*
        Try adding code here to manually remove all features from source
    */
    selectedLayerSource.forEachFeature(function(feature){
        selectedLayerSource.removeFeature(feature);
    });

    console.log(selectedLayerSource.getFeatures());

    console.log(""Loading features from file..."");

    loader.call(selectedLayerSource, [], 1, 'EPSG:3857');

    window.setTimeout(function(){
        console.log(selectedLayerSource.getFeatures());
        map.updateSize();
    }, 500);
</code></pre>

<p>Which outputs into the console:</p>

<pre><code>""time: 1471462410554  format: [object Object]  url: http://server/file.ext?t=1471462410554"" file.php:484:3
Array [ Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, 1 more… ] file.php:491:3

GET XHR http://server/file.ext [HTTP/1.1 200 OK 34ms]
Array [ Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, 1 more… ]
</code></pre>

<p>After several tests with GeoJSON and KML layers I confirmed that this method works!!!</p>

<p>However, because the loader makes its request asynchronously, I am left with the problem of how to execute code after the loader function has been called. Obviously using setTimeout() is a horrible way to do this and was only implemented for testing purposes. A success/failure callback function would be perfect and when looking at the source of featureloader.js it appears that they are offered as parameters in ol.featureloader.loadFeaturesXhr. See below code block from featureloader.js:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @param {string|ol.FeatureUrlFunction} url Feature URL service.
 * @param {ol.format.Feature} format Feature format.
 * @param {function(this:ol.VectorTile, Array.&lt;ol.Feature&gt;, ol.proj.Projection)|function(this:ol.source.Vector, Array.&lt;ol.Feature&gt;)} success
 *     Function called with the loaded features and optionally with the data
 *     projection. Called with the vector tile or source as `this`.
 * @param {function(this:ol.VectorTile)|function(this:ol.source.Vector)} failure
 *     Function called when loading failed. Called with the vector tile or
 *     source as `this`.
 * @return {ol.FeatureLoader} The feature loader.
 */
ol.featureloader.loadFeaturesXhr = function(url, format, success, failure)
</code></pre>

<p>I attempted to implement these functions like so when creating the loader:</p>

<pre><code>loader = ol.featureloader.xhr(url, format, 
        function(){
            console.log(selectedLayerSource.getFeatures());
            map.updateSize();
            console.log(""Successful load!"");
        },
        function(){
            console.log(""Could not load ""+selectedLayerName+"" layer data from ""+url);
        }
    );
</code></pre>

<p>but neither function is being called. Any suggestions? I feel like I am missing something really simple here...</p>

<p><strong>Update 7:</strong></p>

<p>Using the solution provided by @Jonatas Walker I adapted it to use jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>        var now = Date.now();
        var format = selectedLayerSource.getFormat();
        var url = selectedLayerSource.getUrl();
        url = url + '?t=' + now;

        //make AJAX request to source url
        $.ajax({url: url, success: function(result){

            //manually remove features from the source
            selectedLayerSource.forEachFeature(function(feature){
                selectedLayerSource.removeFeature(feature);
            });

            //create features from AJAX results
            var features = format.readFeatures(result, {
                featureProjection: 'EPSG:3857'
            });

            //add features to the source
            selectedLayerSource.addFeatures(features);

        },
        error: function(err){
            alert(""Could not load features from ""+selectedLayerName+"" at ""+url+"" error code: ""+err.status);
        }
        });
</code></pre>

<p>After extensive testing with GeoJSON and KML sources this has proved an extremely reliable refresh method!</p>

<p>Right now we are using a spreadsheet and for each app we fill in name, short description, contact person and maintainer (internal or vendor). The puspose is to use this list for IT planning and incident management (impact estimation, etc.) In order to do this, as a minimum we need to start adding relations like 'depends on', 'part of' or 'supersedes'. It would be also useful if a future solution would allow tagging, adding indexed key-value pairs, comments and attachments to each entry.</p>

<p>We will NOT want to discover all deployed instances of the applications, manage configuration settings, integrate monitoring have complex security settings and get burried in meta-meta-schemata. Anything that requires a dedicated administrator is already too heavy. </p>

<p>We have the following non-functional requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should allow multiple users to work concurrently on it</li>
<li>Every change should be versioned</li>
<li>Easy export to XML or some other easy to parse format</li>
</ul>

<p>So far we have considered the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Put the spreadsheet on a Confluence wiki, where we can edit it via WebDav (and get locking and versioning)</li>
<li>Use the Confluence wiki since it provides tagging, hierarchy, metadata and links. The only concern is that a wiki is too freeform and it may be difficult to extract the information should we decide to migrate to another system.</li>
<li>DabbleDB.com - has everything we need, but unfortunately the data should not leave the firewall.</li>
<li>OneCMDB.org - I am not sure how easy it is to capture ad-hock information and evolve the schema. Would appreciate experiences.</li>
<li>Zenoss.com - haven't checked it yet. Looks too focused on network management.</li>
<li>Lightweight registry (Mule Galaxy, WSO2 Registry) - not sure if this is the right tool for the job, though they offer a lot of the facilities we need (attributes, labels, versions, lifecycles).</li>
<li>BMC Atrium - complex, corporate politics would require a number of unnecesarry procedures. Unless it offers some huge benefit, we'd rather stick with opensource.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interested on feedback/ideas from people that have successfully gone through a similar endeavor or have experience with some of the approaches above. Also, I would appreciate advice about common pitfalls and recommendations.</p>

<p>There are several classes; ThingA, ThingB and ThingC that inherit from Thing; and I want to be able to have code something like this in the method.</p>

<p>If anyone has any idea about what I can do pleas let me know.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>The reason for needing this is that I'm trying to parse a text file that contains lines with Norwegian and Chinese words, like a dictionary. I want to split the line in to strings, one containing the Norwegian word and one containing the Chinese. This will later be inserted in a database. Example lines:</p>

<p>impulsiv 形 衝動的</p>

<p>imøtegå 動 反對，反駁</p>

<p>imøtekomme 動 符合</p>

<p>alkoholmisbruk(er) 名 濫用酒精 (名 濫用酒精的人)</p>

<p>alkoholpåvirket 形 受酒精影響的</p>

<p>alkotest 名 呼吸性酒精測試</p>

<p>alkymi(st) 名 煉金術 (名 煉金術士)</p>

<p>all, alt, alle, 形 全部, 所有 </p>

<p>As you can see there might be spaces between the words so I can not use something easy like explode to split between the Chinese and Norwegian words. What I do is use the isNorwegianChar and loop through the line until I find a char that is not in the array.</p>

<p>The problem is that it æ, ø and å is not returned as a Norwegian character and it think the Chinese word has started.</p>

<p>Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>   //Open file.
$rFile = fopen(""norsk-kinesisk.txt"", ""r"");

// Loop through the file.
$Count = 0;
while(!feof($rFile))
{
    if(40== $Count)
    {
        break;
    }

    $sLine = fgets($rFile);

    if(0 == $Count)
    {
        $sLine = mb_substr($sLine, 3);
    }

    $iLineLength        = strlen($sLine);
    $bChineseHasStarted = false;
    $sNorwegianWord     = '';
    $sChineseWord       = '';
    for($iCount2 = 0; $iCount2 &lt; $iLineLength; $iCount2++)
    {
        $char = mb_substr($sLine, $iCount2, 1);

        if(($bChineseHasStarted === false) &amp;&amp; (false == isNorwegianChar($char)))
        {
            $bChineseHasStarted = true;
        }

        if(false === $bChineseHasStarted)
        {
            $sNorwegianWord .= $char;
        }
        else
        {
            $sChineseWord .= $char;
        }

        //echo $char;
    }

    $sNorwegianWord = trim($sNorwegianWord);

<p>I have done some coding shown below:</p>

1-pchisq(-2.273737e-13,1)
# lm and glm give the same estimation
# so glm.02 will be used from now on

# see if lmer without level2 variable give same result as glm.02
mlm.03 &lt;- lmer(height~age_central+occasion_id+(1|dummy),data=oxford.df,REML=FALSE)

# 1-pchisq(-3.408097e-07,1)
# glm.02 and mlm.03 give the same estimation, only if REML=FALSE
</code></pre>

<p><code>mlm.03</code> gives me the following output:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; mlm.03

</code></pre>

<p>You can see that there is a variance for the residual in the <code>random effect</code> section, which I have read from <code>Applied Multilevel Analysis - A Practical Guide</code> by Jos W.R. Twisk, that this represents the amount of ""unexplained variance"" from the model.</p>

<p>I wondered if I could arrive at the same residual variance from <code>glm.02</code>, so I tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; var(resid(glm.01))
[1] 64.98952
&gt; sd(resid(glm.01))
[1] 8.061608
</code></pre>

<p>The results are slightly different from the <code>mlm.03</code> output. Does this refer to the same ""residual variance"" stated in <code>mlm.03</code>?</p>

<p>We'd like to use the CI server to kick off (nightly) builds whose version contain a build number, as in 1.0.0.build#. These builds would be installed in our local maven repository to be used by other projects. So the CI server would manage the versions, maven would build the project, and the maven repository would make the builds accessible to other projects.</p>

<p>I intended to initiate the build from the CI server using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>mvn -Dversion=1.0.0.25 install

<p>So since this issue has existed since 08/2006 and has not been fixed, I assume that this is somehow not '<em>the maven way</em>'. So my question is, how can maven be used in a continuous integration situation to install versioned artifacts in the repository?</p>

I'm working on a Python module called <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/psutil/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>psutil</strong></a> for reading process information in a cross-platform way. One of the functions is a <code>pid_exists(pid)</code> function for determining if a PID is in the current process list.</p>

<p>Right now I'm doing this the obvious way, using <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682629(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">EnumProcesses()</a> to pull the process list, then interating through the list and looking for the PID. However, some simple benchmarking shows this is dramatically slower than the pid_exists function on UNIX-based platforms (Linux, OS X, FreeBSD) where we're using <code>kill(pid, 0)</code> with a 0 signal to determine if a PID exists. Additional testing shows it's EnumProcesses that's taking up almost all the time.</p>

<p>Anyone know a faster way than using EnumProcesses to determine if a PID exists? I tried <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684320(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenProcess()</a> and checking for an error opening the nonexistent process, but this turned out to be over 4x slower than iterating through the EnumProcesses list, so that's out as well. Any other (better) suggestions?</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This is a Python library intended to avoid third-party lib dependencies like pywin32 extensions. I need a solution that is faster than our current code, and that doesn't depend on pywin32 or other modules not present in a standard Python distribution.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: To clarify - we're well aware that there are race conditions inherent in reading process iformation. We raise exceptions if the process goes away during the course of data collection or we run into other problems. The pid_exists() function isn't intended to replace proper error handling.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Apparently my earlier benchmarks were flawed - I wrote some simple test apps in C and EnumProcesses consistently comes out slower and OpenProcess (in conjunction with GetProcessExitCode in case the PID is valid but the process has stopped) is actually much <em>faster</em> not slower.</p>

As tends to be the case your local development environment rarely matches your live one and as you build more and more projects you tend to build up a local library of installed modules. These then lead to you not necessarily noticing that your latest project has a requirement on a non-core module. As there is generally a requirement to package the entire project up for deployment to another group (in our case our operations team), it is important to know what modules should be included in the package.  </p>

<p>Does anyone have any insights into the problem.</p>

<pre><code>var guiPath = txtGuiPath.Text;
MessageBox.Show(""Dumping File: "" + guiPath);

try
{
    var writer = new XmlTextWriter(""client_settings.xml"", null);
    writer.WriteStartDocument();
    writer.WriteComment(""Config generated on 01/01/01"");
    writer.WriteStartElement(""Config"");
    writer.WriteStartElement(""GuiPath"");
    writer.WriteString(guiPath);
    writer.WriteEndElement();
    writer.WriteEndElement();
    writer.WriteEndDocument();
    writer.Close();
} catch (Exception ex) {
    MessageBox.Show(ex.Message);
}
MessageBox.Show(""Finished Dumping"");
</code></pre>

<p>If guiPath is blank I get the following XML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;
&lt;!--Config generated on 01/01/01--&gt;
&lt;Config&gt;
    &lt;GuiPath /&gt;
&lt;/Config&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but if there is any text inside guiPath then nothing gets written to the file. I can even delete the client_settings.xml file and fire this code off over and over and the XML file never gets generated unless guiPath is empty. Passing something like ""This is a test"" to WriteString() works as well.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Since I'm trying to write out a system path, that seems to be the problem. If I strip out all the backslashes it will write the resulting string correctly, but if I pass it to WriteString or WriteCData the XML will not write at all.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>Turns out that the reason I was having so many problems is because the XML file was being generated in whatever path guiPath was set to, not into the directory that the app was running from (so to me it looked like it wasn't being generated at all). So, if I had guiPath set to 'C:\Program Files\externalApp\appName.exe', it was saving the XML file as 'C:\ProgramFiles\externalApp\client_settings.xml' instead of in the startup folder for the app. Why, I don't know. I started passing Application.StartupPath and appended the filename to that and it works great now.</p>

<li>will be active for whole of windows, not just our app</li>
<li>may not (probably is not) appropriate to do when installing the app</li>
<li>allows to specify explicitly through path only which version of the app to launch if there is a 32 bit and 64 bit version</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use the windows API to temporarily disable the redirection when showing file lists or executing users run commands. Issues are:

<ul>
<li>Only available on 64 bit - have to mess with GetProcAddress</li>
<li>available only under certain service packs</li>
<li>must individually identify all locations that this should be implemented</li>
<li>user will need to provide seperate information about whether this is a 64 bit app or 32 bit.</li>

<p>The thing is that many of them are only used within the library itself and should NOT be used by the developers (could create a disaster) when they incorporate my library in their application - only a few should be visibile i.e. the ones which are needed by the developer.</p>

<p>Thus, my question is: is there a way to hide certain methods/properties of my library from Visual Studio's IntelliSense? Maybe something similar to REM? </p>

<p>1) how to hide something from IntelliSense</p>

<p>2) how to prevent a developer from using and calling certain methods/properties</p>

<p>Of course, the end-result that I want is that the developer is not able to access AT ALL certain methods/properties i.e. No. 2 above.</p>

<p>I'm a Python programmer, and I could fly over the project with Django. There are several reasons I prefer PHP though:</p>

<p>1) Django installation, and configuration assumes you have access to a shell (my target is not the programmer type). Although I could offer installation service, but not on their servers.</p>

<p>2) Django runs only on some specific hosts that must take special care to enable it. Installing mod_python/mod_wsgi, and most likely the minority of my potential clients would have root access, or even a cpanel.</p>

<p>3) Using PHP would mean I could run it on their existing server. I would have no need to move them to a Django-enabled server, and no downtime for their emails, while the DNS updates.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I have very little experience with PHP. Smarty as a templating language looks nice, and works similarly to Django templates. It doesn't offer template inheritance though, except in a very hackish way in which I wish not to use as it could break the application if the designer messes them up. What do you think?

"576886","1","576975","","2009-02-23 08:26:09","","7","6465","<p><strong>The background</strong></p>

<p>In .NET <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Windows Forms</a> (2.0) radio buttons are automatically grouped by their container control, whether it is a Form, Panel or GroupBox. </p>

<p>That means that when you select one radio button, every other radio button in the same container is automatically changed to unchecked state.</p>

<p>Now, consider the following form layout:</p>

<pre><code>MUST HAVE  NICE TO HAVE  DESCRIPTION
---------  ------------  -----------------------------------------------
   [ ]          [ ]      The gizmo works
   [ ]          [ ]      The gizmo works beautifully
   [ ]          [ ]      The gizmo works amazingly and makes you breakfast
   [ ]          [ ]      The gizmo comes with a pony
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Each <code>'[ ]'</code> is a radio button.</li>
<li>The user is asked to choose the <em>required</em> answer in column one, and the <em>optional</em> (desired, best-case answer) in column 2. </li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, the radio buttons should be grouped by column: selecting one of the radios should clear the rest of the column, but should have no effect in the other column.</p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>

<p>Basically the problem is that this is a dynamically generated form.</p>

<ul>
<li>The number of rows in the layout is dynamic and it is loaded from a configurable form definition.</li>
<li>The description text is not known until runtime and lengths vary a great deal (some might have just a couple of words, and some others a dozen of lines).</li>
<li>The layout cannot be redesigned. This comes from the familiarity of the (non-technical) users with the paper version of this form that has been in use for years. This form will also printed and even if I changed the input system on my form that would mean coding another version for printing with the 'old' layout.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What I have tried and didn't work</strong></p>

<p>I first tried to implement this as a dynamically generated layout using three panels, one for each column, so the automatic radio button grouping would work just fine. And it did.</p>

<p>But the layout problems related to horizontal alignment between the radio buttons and its text are just killing me. The size of the text is not known until runtime and the text lines might wrap (sometimes several times for each item). Sometimes it aligns properly, sometimes it doesn't. I'm about to start debugging this, but I'm thinking if maybe changing this three-panel implementation is a better option.</p>

<p><strong>What I'm trying to do</strong></p>

<p>I would like to redesign the layout by using a <code>TableLayoutPanel</code> with three columns in order to simplify the alignment related issues, but that means that I cannot use the automatic radio button grouping-by-container ""feature"".</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>As Gerrie suggested, other layout option is to have each line implemented as a user control and use a flow layout panel.</p>

<p>That means, again, that I might want to use controls for layout, but not for radio button grouping. </p>

<p><em>I would need to get vertical radio button groups despite using horizontal user controls</em></p>

<p>/EDIT</p>

<p><strong>What I'm trying to ask</strong></p>

<p>I need pointers and suggestions about how to manually control the grouping of the radio buttons. I really don't mind subclassing the <code>RadioButton</code> class if needed. </p>

<p>Specifically, is there any 'canonical' or known way of subclassing 'RadioButton' or go all the way down to Win32 APIs, so that every time the control is checked (by using the mouse, keyboard Enter, Space bar, and any other way that I could not be aware of selecting them) I can trap the event and manually update the state of every other control on my form and in a way that the automatic grouping feature is well known to be 'de-activated'? I fear that the implementation is also container-related, and I might be also forced to subclass Panel?.</p>

<p>How does the grouping 'magic' work in Windows Forms?</p>

<p>Every solution I have found googling that implements custom radio button groups or 'radio button lists' is based in some way in using a container for the group. Can containers be avoided? If so, how?.</p>

"574520","1","574608","","2009-02-22 07:19:43","","10","6466","<h2>DTO</h2>

<p>I'm building a Web application I would like to scale to many users. Also, I need to expose functionality to trusted third parties via Web Services.</p>

<p>I'm using LLBLGen to generate the data access layer (using SQL Server 2008). The goal is to build a business logic layer that shields the Web App from the details of DAL and, of course, to provide an extra level of validation beyond the DAL. Also, as far as I can tell right now, the Web Service will essentially be a thin wrapper over the BLL. </p>

<p>The DAL, of course, has its own set of entity objects, for instance, CustomerEntity, ProductEntity, and so forth. However, I don't want the presentation layer to have access to these objects directly, as they contain DAL specific methods and the assembly is specific to the DAL and so on. So, the idea is to create Data Transfer Objects (DTO). The idea is that these will be, essentially, plain old C#/.NET objects that have all the fields of, say, a CustomerEntity that are actually the database table Customer but none of the other stuff, except maybe some IsChanged/IsDirty properties. So, there would be CustomerDTO, ProductDTO, etc. I assume these would inherit from a base DTO class. I believe I can generate these with some template for LLBLGen, but I'm not sure about it yet.</p>

<p>So, the idea is that the BLL will expose its functionality by accepting and returning these DTO objects. I think the Web Service will handle converting these objects to XML for the third parties using it, many may not be using .NET (also, some things will be script callable from AJAX calls on the Web App, using JSON).</p>

<p>I'm not sure the best way to design this and exactly how to go forward. Here are some issues:</p>

<p>1) How should this be exposed to the clients (The presentation tier and to the Web Service code)</p>

<p>I was thinking that there would be one public class that has these methods, every call would be be an atomic operation:</p>

<p>InsertDTO, UpdateDTO, DeleteDTO, GetProducts, GetProductByCustomer, and so forth ...</p>

<p>Then the clients would just call these methods and pass in the appropriate arguments, typically a DTO.</p>

<p>Is this a good, workable approach?</p>

<p>2) What to return from these methods? Obviously, the Get/Fetch sort of methods will return DTO. But what about Inserts? Part of the signature could be:</p>

<pre><code>InsertDTO(DTO dto)
</code></pre>

<p>However, when inserting what should be returned? I want to be notified of errors. However, I use autoincrementing primary keys for some tables (However, a few tables have natural keys, particularly many-to-many ones).</p>

<p>One option I thought about was a Result class:</p>

<pre><code>class Result
{
    public Exception Error {get; set;}
    public DTO AffectedObject {get; set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, on an insert, the DTO would get its get ID (like CustomerDTO.CustomerID) property set and then put in this result object. The client will know if there is an error if Result.Error != null and then it would know the ID from the Result.AffectedObject property.</p>

<p>Is this a good approach? One problem is that it seems like it is passing a lot of data back and forth that is redundant (when it's just the ID). I don't think adding a ""int NewID"" property would be clean because some inserts will not have a autoincrementing key like that. Another issue is that I don't think Web Services would handle this well? I believe they would just return the base DTO for AffectedObject in the Result class, rather than the derived DTO. I suppose I could solve this by having a LOT of the different kinds of Result objects (maybe derived from a base Result and inherit the Error property) but that doesn't seem very clean.</p>

<p>All right, I hope this isn't too wordy but I want to be clear.</p>

<p>It installed like a dream, so the first thing I did was remove the anonymous account and setup an ""admin"" account with ""mysecretpassword"" and specified the asadmin group for this user in the admin realm.</p>

<p>At that point the <strong>stop-domain</strong> command stopped working from the console (and/or start menu shortcut). Fair enough, but the stop-domain command accepts a --user argument but then wants a --passwordfile path supplied which I didn't know where it was.</p>

<p>After some googling I chanced upon <strong>asaadmin login -p 4848</strong> which created a password file in my documents and then stop-domain started working!</p>

<p>So the questions:</p>

<p>1) Is it possible to get stop-domain to prompt for a user/password?</p>

<p>2) This whole business of having a file with a (hashed) password doesn't sound great to me - why did they do it this way, and is it transferable, can it be disabled and if it can, how then do I stop the domain?</p>

<p>3) How do security realms work - as in what are they, and how do they differ?</p>

<p>4) What's the best resource (book, website, whatever) on GF v3?</p>

<pre><code>request for http://example.com/images/name.jpg  routed to  http://i.example.com/name.jpg
request for http://example.com/css/name.css     routed to  http://c.example.com/name.css
</code></pre>

<p>From listening to the Stack Overflow podcast, I learned that this could make a site faster, since <strong>the browser can download more files simultaneously</strong> (apparently two streams per domain, although this is unconfirmed).</p>

<p>Indeed, the difference is dramatic; the page loads about <strong>five times as fast</strong>!</p>

<p>I have not touched the original folders and images -- I am just using mod_rewrite to change the addresses from <strong>example.com/images/</strong> to <strong>i.example.com/</strong>:</p>

<pre>
rewritecond %{HTTP_HOST}     !^i\.example\.com       [NC]
rewriterule ^images/([^/]+)$ http://i.example.com/$1 [L]
rewritecond %{HTTP_HOST}     !^c\.example\.com       [NC]
rewriterule ^css/([^/]+)$    http://c.example.com/$1 [L]
</pre>

<p>The problem I have is that this technique works perfectly for image tags included in html, but doesn't work for images included via stylesheets:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>img src=/images/logo.jpg</strong> works perfectly</p>
  
  <p><strong>background:url(/images/logo.jpg);</strong> does not work</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The server error log contains the following entry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>File does not exist: /var/www/html/css/images, referer: <a href=""http://example.com/page.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://example.com/page.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to imply that the rewrite rule is being applied incorrectly.</p>

<p>The stylesheets work if I use:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>background:url(<a href=""http://i.example.com/logo.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://i.example.com/logo.jpg</a>);</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, in order to avoid rewriting all the style sheets, I'd like to know: <strong>why doesn't url rewriting apply to stylesheets the way it does to html img tags</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>[update1]</strong> This problem exists in Safari 4 Beta, Firefox 3.0.3, and Chrome, but the <strong>page works perfectly in IE6</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>[update2]</strong> Adding [L,R=301] and [L,R=302] did not help.</p>

<p><strong>[update3]</strong> I tried the following based on Gumbo's suggestion below:</p>

<p>Redirect externally if path doesn’t match host name:</p>

<pre><code>rewritecond %{HTTP_HOST}     !^i\.domain\.com$
rewriterule ^images/([^/]+)$ http://i.domain.com/$1 [L,R=301]
rewritecond %{HTTP_HOST}     !^c\.domain\.com$
rewriterule ^css/([^/]+)$    http://c.domain.com/$1 [L,R=301]
</code></pre>

<p>Redirect internally; if there's an unnecessary folder name remove it (see server error above):</p>

<pre><code>rewritecond %{HTTP_HOST}     ^i\.domain\.com$
rewriterule ^images/([^/]+)$ $1 [L]
rewritecond %{HTTP_HOST}     ^c\.domain\.com$
rewriterule ^css/([^/]+)$    $1 [L]
</code></pre>

<p>It still didn't work. Bizarrely, the server error is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>File does not exist: /var/www/html/css/var, referer: <a href=""http://domain.com/page.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://domain.com/page.html</a></p>

I found a very basic open source applet for uploading files that I copied and modified for this last bit.</p>

<p>The trouble is, though, it doesn't quite work. It seems like it's running fine, but then I run into two snags related to permissions. The messages in the Java Console say that the applet had access denied errors on the following two permissions:</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.RuntimePermission setFactory
java.io.FilePermission read
</code></pre>

<p>I find this strange, because I thought I had granted permission to the applet already when I built it with the ""self-signed"" option checked in NetBeans, and then clicked to confirm the little security pop-up in the browser.</p>

<p>Also, the part that I coded myself, where it reads the file and passes the first line on to JavaScript works fine. This is a pretty clear indicator that the applet is able to read from the local file system! The trouble doesn't start until I actually try to start the upload. One thing to note, I suppose, is that the upload process seems to run in a new thread, whereas the rest of it all runs in the main class without creating threads.</p>

<p>I am a total novice to Java and know very little about threads in Java; do I need to pass the permissions onto this new thread somehow? Or something to that effect? 
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>We have some barcodes generated by an existing app that uses the Barcode.4NET library. The barcode is in Code 128A format. The code to generate them is pretty simple, looking something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Create the barcode
Code128ABarcode c128A = new Code128ABarcode(""045746201627080857"");
</code></pre>

<p>No other parameters are set for it - after setting the data, we just get a GIF version of the barcode back from the library.</p>

<p>I'm working on a new app that is using iTextSharp for PDF generation and I figured that instead of using two libraries, I would use iTextSharp's barcode generation library since it supports Code128 barcodes. It has a few different variations of Code 128, but none of them are ""Code 128A"".</p>

<p>Here is what the code looks like for it:</p>

<pre><code>Barcode128 code128 = new Barcode128();
code128.CodeType = Barcode.CODE128;
code128.ChecksumText = true;
code128.GenerateChecksum = true;
code128.StartStopText = true;
code128.Code = ""045746201627080857"";

<p>The image on top is generated by iTextSharp and the one on the bottom is generated by Barcode4Net. Obviously, they aren't the same (and not just in the size and the font - the barcoded data is pretty different).</p>

One of the idea's I've been touting is the strength of the strongly typed column's, mainly for not needing to cast any data. Am I wrong in thinking that strongly-typed-datasets would improve performance in the following situation where there could be potentially thousands of rows?</p>

<p>old way:</p>

<pre><code>using(DataTable dt = sql.ExecuteSomeQuery())
{
    foreach (DataRow dr in dt.Rows)
    {
        var something = (string)dr[""something""];
        var somethingelse = (int)dr[""somethingelse""];
    }
}

<p>new way:</p>

<pre><code>MyDataAdapter.Fill(MyDataset);
foreach (DataRow dr in MyDataset.MyDT.Rows)
{
    var something = dr.Something;
    var somethingelse = dr.SomethingElse;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the properties are really just doing the casting behind the scenes, I can see how there wouldn't be any speedup at all; perhaps it would take even longer then before with the overhead of the function call in the first place. </p>

<p>Are there any other performance strengths / weaknesses of using DataSets we should know about?</p>

<p>The situation is, the amount of transaction made by users are double of the transaction processed by our program. Most of the running time of the program are dominated by DB transactions.</p>

<p>I've search through the internet and browsed some sites ( for example: <a href=""http://www.javaperformancetuning.com/tips/rawtips.shtml"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.javaperformancetuning.com/tips/rawtips.shtml</a> ) talking about Java performace in DB, but I cannot find a suggestion suitable for us.</p>

<p>These advices are not applicable/already used, for instance:</p>

<p><strong>1. Use prepared statements. Use parameterized SQL</strong></p>

<p>Already used prepared statement. Each time will use different parameter by clear parameters and set parameters.</p>

<p><strong>2. Tune the SQL to minimize the data returned (e.g. not 'SELECT *').</strong> </p>

<p>Sure, already used.</p>

<p><strong>3. Use connection pooling.</strong> </p>

<p>We hold a single connection during the program's execution. And I doubt that pooling cannot solve the problem because our program act as 1 user, so there are no problem for concurrent access to DB. If anyone of you think pooling is good, please tell me why. Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>4. Try to combine queries and batch updates.</strong> </p>

<p>Cannot do it. Every query/insert/update is depend on the database's information. For example, we look up the DB for the client's information, if we cannot find his usage, we insert the usage into DB, otherwise we do update.</p>

<p><strong>5. Close resources (Connections, Statements, ResultSets) when finished</strong></p>

<p>Sure.</p>

<p><strong>6. Select the fastest JDBC driver.</strong> </p>

<p>I don't know. I've search on the internet about the type of driver available and I am very confused. We use <code>oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver</code> and we use thin instead of oci, that's all I know. In addition, our program is a two-tier way ( java &lt;-> oracle )</p>

However, everything in the documentation and in the UI seems to make an assumption that the application/assembly only wants to use a single database and never wishes to create new ones based on the existing schema.</p>

<p>I'd like to be able to edit the DB schema using visual tools and then to have a mechanism for creating new database files based on the edited schema.  This way each document that my application creates would be stored in their own separate database files (.sdf).  Furthermore, for the purpose of unit testing, I'd like to be able to create empty temporary .sdf files in order to run my unit tests on an empty database.</p>

<p>The only way I know how to create new empty databases using an existing schema is just to copy my master .sdf file to a new file.</p>

<p>What would be the recommended way to create new .sdf files using C# code?  I.e., how to implement MyModel.Create(""foo.sdf"") so that it creates .sdf files using the schema I've created in Visual Studio.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: After a long investigation, I ended up ditching VS2008 local database .sdf editor completely and started creating new .sdf files by using LINQ-to-SQL.  I now just specify a bunch of C# classes, annotate them to work with LINQ-to-SQL and create new database files by calling my DataContext's CreateDatabase method.

<p>So... you say the POST_DATA should be 'a=upload&amp;file[]=FILE'?</p>

<p>Update2:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form method=""post"" action=""/"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"" onsubmit=""javascript:Upload(); return true;""&gt;

&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""a"" value=""upload"" /&gt;

&lt;td class=""left""&gt;File:&lt;/td&gt;
td class=""right""&gt;&lt;input name=""file[]"" type=""file"" size=""20"" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That's the code... </p>

<p>Now it's working the form-data configuration, but it's not uploading the file I believe</p>

<p>c.setopt( c.POSTFIELDS, 'a=upload&amp;file[]=/datos/poop1.jpg' )</p>

<p>I'm getting this:</p>

Being a programmer, I have poked and prodded with the system and found that it submits the username and password via a HTTP GET request.
On the domain it is run on, all computers are set to bypass the proxy, so the URL with the request won't be saved in some proxy log somewhere.
But I would argue this is an unsafe way of handling username and passwords anyway.</p>

<p>The vendor will argue that since we never asked for it, it will be an 'enhancement' which will require additional $$$. (We never wrote the specifications for the system in the first place).</p>

<p>What kind of case could I make to management to make them feel this isn't to standard and that probably the only way this system would be secure is through HTTPS?</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks for all your responses!
I have raised the issue with the project leader, her response was along the lines of ""what's HTTP?"".
So I plan to explain it all to her in better detail, investigate the legal implications and try to raise the issue with the programmers directly asking why they went that path.  I will also try and explain the situation to other colleagues who don't have any direct involvement but may be able to have some influence on the matter.</p>

<p>The service is fronted by BIGIP which handles SSL encryption and decryption and forwards the unencrypted request to ServerA (at the moment it does NOT actually do any load balancing, but that is likely to be added in the future) on a specific port.</p>

<p>What that means is that our clients would be calling the service through <a href=""https://www.OurDomain.com/ServiceUrl"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.OurDomain.com/ServiceUrl</a> and would get to our service on <a href=""http://SeverA:85/ServiceUrl"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://SeverA:85/ServiceUrl</a> through the BIGIP device; </p>

<p>When we browse to the WSDL published on <a href=""https://www.OurDomain.com/ServiceUrl"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.OurDomain.com/ServiceUrl</a> all the addresses contained in the WSDL are based on the <a href=""http://SeverA:85/ServiceUrl"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://SeverA:85/ServiceUrl</a> base address</p>

<p>We figured out that we could use the host headers setting to set the domain, but our problem is that while this would sort out the domain, we would  still be using the wrong scheme – it would use <a href=""http://www.OurDomain.com/ServiceUrl"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.OurDomain.com/ServiceUrl</a> while we need it to be Https. </p>

<p>Also – as we have other services (asmx based) hosted on that server we had some issues setting the host headers, and so we thought we could get away with creating another site on the server (using, say, port 82) and set the host header on that; now, on top of the http/https problem we have an issue as the WSDL contains the port number in all the urls, where BigIP works on port 443 (for the SSL)</p>

<p>Is there a more flexible solution than implementing Host Headers?  Ideally we need to retain flexibility and ease of supportability.</p>

This is an example of what a call might look like:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    url: ""userCreation.ashx"",
    data: { u:userName, p:password, e:email },
    type: ""POST"",
    beforeSend: function(){disableSubmitButton();},
    complete: function(){enableSubmitButton();},
    error: function(xhr, statusText, errorThrown){
            // Work out what the error was and display the appropriate message
        },
    success: function(data){
            displayUserCreatedMessage();
            refreshUserList();
        }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The request might fail for a number of reasons, such as duplicate user name, duplicate email address etc, and the ashx is written to throw an exception when this happens.</p>

<p>My problem seems to be that by throwing an exception the ashx causes the <code>statusText</code> and <code>errorThrown</code> to be <strong>undefined</strong>.</p>

<p>I can get to the <code>XMLHttpRequest.responseText</code> which contains the HTML that makes up the standard .net error page.</p>

<p>I am finding the page title in the responseText and using the title to work out which error was thrown. Although I have a suspicion that this will fall apart when I enable custom error handling pages.</p>

<p>Should I be throwing the errors in the ashx, or should I be returning a status code as part of the data returned by the call to <code>userCreation.ashx</code>, then using this to decide what action to take?<br>
How do you handle these situations?</p>

<p>This reproduction sample is a simple console application that creates a Canvas and adds a Line to it. It does this continually. This is all the code does. It sleeps every now and again to ensure that the CPU is not so taxed that your system is unresponsive (and to ensure there's no weirdness with the GC not being able to run). </p>

<p>NOTE: the first answer below is a bit off-base since I explicitly stated already that this same behavior occurs during a WPF application's button click event. I did not explicitly state, however, that in that app I only do a limited number of iterations (say 1000). Doing it that way would allow the GC to run as you click around the application. Also note that I explicitly said I've taken a memory dump and found my objects were rooted via !gcroot. I also disagree that the GC would not be able to run. The GC does not run on my console application's main thread, especially since I'm on a dual core machine which means the Concurrent Workstation GC is active. Message pump, however, yes.</p>

<p>To prove the point, here's a WPF application version that runs the test on a DispatcherTimer. It performs 1000 iterations during a 100ms timer interval. More than enough time to process any messages out of the pump and keep the CPU usage low.</p>

<p>NOTE2: I used the code from the first answer and my memory grew very slowly. Note that 1ms is much slower and less iterations than my example. You have to let it run for a couple minutes before you start to notice growth. After 5 minutes it's at 46MB from a starting point of 30MB. </p>

<p>NOTE3: Removing the call to .Arrange completely eliminates the growth. Unfortunately, that call is pretty vital to my use since in many cases I'm creating PNG files from the Canvas (via the RenderTargetBitmap class). Without the call to .Arrange it doesn't layout the canvas at all.</p>

I've used PHPMailer for mailing, but I've also tried using PHP's mail() function directly. In both instances, I get the same problem described below. I've tried sending as multipart as well as sending just the HTML version.</p>

<p>In every email client I tried, the emails arrive just fine. By that I mean the email is recognized as an HTML email and the content is rendered. Except on some accounts on <strong>Outlook Express</strong>. I've not been able to discern why it works for some people and why it doesn't work for others (all using Outlook Express). I have forwarded HTML emails to this account (from gmail as well as from outlook express) and they show up just fine. So the Outlook Express version is definitely capable of showing HTML emails.</p>

<p>Now, in these failing cases, the Outlook Express ignores a significant part of the mail header. I can actually see this: when I view the <strong>original source</strong> of the email, it shows a part in bold - the header - and a part not in bold - the body.</p>

<p>Below is the email message. I've redacted some ""personal"" parts.</p>

<p>This part is in bold, recognized by Outlook Express as the header:</p>

I've done most of my Python work in Windows up until now, and am finding the choices for OS X a little daunting. It looks like there are at least five options to use for Python development:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Stock"" Apple Python</li>
<li>MacPython</li>
<li>Fink</li>
<li>MacPorts</li>
<li>roll-your-own-from-source</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm still primarily developing for 2.5, so the stock Python is fine from a functionality standpoint. What I want to know is: why should I choose one over the other?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
To clarify, I am looking for a discussion of the various options, not links to the documentation. I've marked this as a Community Wiki question, as I don't feel there is a ""correct"" answer. Thanks to everyone who has already commented for their insight.</p>

However, I want there to be an additional row, or control that always appears after the last data row.</p>

<p>I can get the additional control to appear after the last row using a <code>ControlTemplate</code> and setting the RowsPresenter row to Auto height, but this means the rows never scroll when the render area gets too small. However, if I change the RowsPresenter row height to Star, the rows scroll but the additional control appears pinned to the bottom of the data grid rather than to the bottom of the last row.</p>

<p>Is there a way I can have the Star height behavior on the RowsPresenter while still having my control appear the way I want?</p>

<p>My current thinking is that I need to somehow use the LoadingRow event to find the position of the last row and use a Canvas or similar to place my control in the appropriate location.</p>

<p>I also asked a question (and ultimately answered) about pinning one control below another, which could be used to fix this issue if you don't want the custom row to scroll with the rest of the rows (such as in my case, where I wanted another datagrid header row to show totals and float over the other rows).</p>

The design gods have decreed it to be fixed height, mainly because each of the columns can potentially get very long, and so (being designers) they are wanting iframes with independent scrollbars.</p>

<p>Four (potential) scrollbars are bad enough, but if the overall page height is fixed higher than the browser window then it'll end up with five! The 'normal' solution in a case like this of course is to fix the overall page height at something like 700 pixels to give it the 'best chance' of fitting vertically, but I don't want to do that for various reasons which I'd hope would be obvious.</p>

<p>So my question is: What would be the best way to have a body container that fills the available (vertical space) with each of the columns doing the same thing? Is it even practical/possible? Bonus question: Can I reliably use the CSS overflow property for the columns or do I need nasty iframes? I have lots of CSS experience, but next to none with using percentage dimensions (especially when combined with pixel dimensions as I'll need for the header). Also, this must be standards-compliant and backwards-compatible to IE6.</p>

<p>TIA.</p>

<p>EDIT: I'm not looking for a CSS layout solution per se, my problem is how to accommodate the need for each column to be the maximum height possible within the body container and scrollable, without fixing the height of the body in pixels - unless I absolutely need to.</p>

The only exception is a specific method which takes a struct as a parameter in the C code. The function is invoked without any exceptions, but it returns false indicating that something failed in the execution.</p>

<p>In the API header file the involved method and structs are defined as follows:</p>

<pre><code>#define MAX_ICE_MS_TRACK_LENGTH  256
typedef struct tagTRACKDATA
{   
    UINT nLength;
    BYTE TrackData[MAX_ICE_MS_TRACK_LENGTH];
} TRACKDATA, FAR* LPTRACKDATA;
typedef const LPTRACKDATA LPCTRACKDATA;

BOOL ICEAPI EncodeMagstripe(HDC /*hDC*/,
             LPCTRACKDATA /*pTrack1*/,
             LPCTRACKDATA /*pTrack2*/,
             LPCTRACKDATA /*pTrack3*/,
             LPCTRACKDATA /*reserved*/);
</code></pre>

<p>I have made an attempt to create a C# P/Invoke wrapper using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>public const int MAX_ICE_MS_TRACK_LENGTH = 256;

[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]
public class MSTrackData {
    public UInt32 nLength;
    public readonly Byte[] TrackData = new byte[MAX_ICE_MS_TRACK_LENGTH];
}

[DllImport(""ICE_API.dll"", CharSet = CharSet.Auto, SetLastError = true)]
public static extern bool EncodeMagstripe(IntPtr hDC,
                    [In]ref MSTrackData pTrack1,
                    [In]ref MSTrackData pTrack2,
                    [In]ref MSTrackData pTrack3,
                    [In]ref MSTrackData reserved);
</code></pre>

<p>Then I try to invoke the EncodeMagstripe method using the following C# code:</p>

<pre><code>CardApi.MSTrackData trackNull = null;
CardApi.MSTrackData track2 = new CardApi.TrackData();
byte[] trackBytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("";0123456789?"");
track2.nLength = (uint)trackBytes.Length;
Buffer.BlockCopy(trackBytes, 0, track2.TrackData, 0, trackBytes.Length);

if (!CardApi.EncodeMagstripe(hDC, ref trackNull, ref track2, ref trackNull, ref trackNull)) {
    throw new ApplicationException(""EncodeMagstripe failed"", Marshal.GetLastWin32Error());
}
</code></pre>

<p>This causes an ApplicationException to be thrown, and the error code is 801 which according to the documentation means ""Data includes too many characters for the selected Track 2 format."". However the selected track format should allow up to 39 characters (I have also tried shorter strings).</p>

<p>I suspect the problem occurrs due to something I did wrong in the MSTrackData definition, but I cannot see what this may be. Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>
