<p>I got a problem with this unordered list. IE seems to add extra top-margin for every li-element, making my navigation look like a flight of stairs:

<p>I'm using conditional comments to target IE. I tried:</p>

<pre><code>ul#mainnav li { top-margin: 0;}
</code></pre>

<p>But that doesn't do anything. I wish there was a Firebug-style plugin for IE, that would make it easier to sort out problems like these.</p>

<p>Any ideas regarding what could be causing this problem?</p>

The only exception is a specific method which takes a struct as a parameter in the C code. The function is invoked without any exceptions, but it returns false indicating that something failed in the execution.</p>

<p>In the API header file the involved method and structs are defined as follows:</p>

<pre><code>#define MAX_ICE_MS_TRACK_LENGTH  256
typedef struct tagTRACKDATA
{   
    UINT nLength;
    BYTE TrackData[MAX_ICE_MS_TRACK_LENGTH];
} TRACKDATA, FAR* LPTRACKDATA;
typedef const LPTRACKDATA LPCTRACKDATA;

BOOL ICEAPI EncodeMagstripe(HDC /*hDC*/,
             LPCTRACKDATA /*pTrack1*/,
             LPCTRACKDATA /*pTrack2*/,
             LPCTRACKDATA /*pTrack3*/,
             LPCTRACKDATA /*reserved*/);
</code></pre>

<p>I have made an attempt to create a C# P/Invoke wrapper using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>public const int MAX_ICE_MS_TRACK_LENGTH = 256;

[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]
public class MSTrackData {
    public UInt32 nLength;
    public readonly Byte[] TrackData = new byte[MAX_ICE_MS_TRACK_LENGTH];
}

[DllImport(""ICE_API.dll"", CharSet = CharSet.Auto, SetLastError = true)]
public static extern bool EncodeMagstripe(IntPtr hDC,
                    [In]ref MSTrackData pTrack1,
                    [In]ref MSTrackData pTrack2,
                    [In]ref MSTrackData pTrack3,
                    [In]ref MSTrackData reserved);
</code></pre>

<p>Then I try to invoke the EncodeMagstripe method using the following C# code:</p>

<pre><code>CardApi.MSTrackData trackNull = null;
CardApi.MSTrackData track2 = new CardApi.TrackData();
byte[] trackBytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("";0123456789?"");
track2.nLength = (uint)trackBytes.Length;
Buffer.BlockCopy(trackBytes, 0, track2.TrackData, 0, trackBytes.Length);

if (!CardApi.EncodeMagstripe(hDC, ref trackNull, ref track2, ref trackNull, ref trackNull)) {
    throw new ApplicationException(""EncodeMagstripe failed"", Marshal.GetLastWin32Error());
}
</code></pre>

<p>This causes an ApplicationException to be thrown, and the error code is 801 which according to the documentation means ""Data includes too many characters for the selected Track 2 format."". However the selected track format should allow up to 39 characters (I have also tried shorter strings).</p>

<p>I suspect the problem occurrs due to something I did wrong in the MSTrackData definition, but I cannot see what this may be. Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

In addition to reading <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/898/internationalization-in-your-projects"">this question</a>, I've also done some of my own research on internationalization in regards to design considerations, but I can't help but suspect that there is a lot more out there that I just don't know or don't know to ask.</p>

<p><strong>Some of the things I've learned:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Some languages read right-to-left
instead of left-to-right.</li>
<li>Calendar, dates, times, currency, and
numbers are displayed differently
from language to language.</li>
<li>Design should be flexible enough to
accommodate a lot more text because
some languages are far more verbose
than others.</li>
<li>Don't take icons or colors for
granted when it comes to their
semantic meaning as this can vary
from culture to culture.</li>
<li>Geographical nomenclature varies from
language to language.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Where I'm at:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>My design is flexible enough to
accommodate a lot more text.</li>
<li>I automatically translate each
string, including error messages and help dialogs.</li>
<li>I haven't come to a point yet where
I've needed to display units of time,
currency or numbers, but I'll be
there shortly and will need to
develop a solution.</li>
<li>I'm using the UTF-8 character set
across the board.</li>
<li>My menus and various lists in the application are sorted
alphabetically for each language for easier reading.</li>
<li>I have a tag parser that extracts
tags by filtering out stop words. The
stop words list is language specific
and can be swapped out.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What I'd like to know more about:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm developing a downloadable PHP web application,
so any specific advice in regards to
PHP would be greatly appreciated.
I've developed my own framework and
am not interested in using other
frameworks at this time.</li>
<li>I know very little about non-western
languages. Are there specific
considerations that need to be taken
into account that I haven't mentioned
above? Also, how do PHP's array
sorting functions handle non-western
characters?</li>
<li>Are there any specific gotchas that
you've experienced in practice? I'm looking in terms of both the GUI and the application code itself.</li>
<li>Any specific advice for working with
date and time displays? Is there a
breakdown according to region or
language?</li>
<li>I've seen a lot of projects and sites
let their communities provide
translation for their applications
and content. Do you recommend this
and what are some good strategies for
ensuring that you have a good
translation?</li>
<li>This question is basically the extent
of what I know about
internationalization. What don't I
know that I don't know that I should
look into further?</li>

My physiotherapist has determined that the worst thing I seem to be doing is using my mouse at such a weird angle.  The problem for me is, I keep my keyboard positioned such that my left and right forearms are angled in the same amount, i.e., my body is centred roughly with the B key.  On my current keyboard, which is not a split, this means the wide Enter key, the arrow keys, and the number pad all jut out to the right before I have space for my mouse.  I have a medium-width frame, but even still, this leaves my wrist at a really awkward angle when using the mouse.  I'd prefer not to have to push my keyboard out of the way every time I switch between the two, but I do use the num pad occasionally, so I wouldn't want a keyboard without that.</p>

<p>I think it'd be ideal to have about a 30-50 cm space between the left and right halves of the keyboard, so my arms are more perpendicular to my collarbone, and the arrow keys and number pad in the middle, maybe even with the numbers on a 45 degree angle, so I could configure them for use with either hand.</p>

<p>(In case you were wondering, then a touch-screen with a stylus that has a right-click modifier button for mousing, because otherwise the mouse pad would be right where I'd put the right half of the home row, in the most natural position for my right arm while sitting.)</p>

<p>With that much space, you could fit so many custom keys for things that you normally use two-key combos for...or you could detach them completely (save for a wire) and just have, you know, actual desktop showing through.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Precomputing one-cycle perfectly bandlimited waveform samples at different bandlimit frequencies at startup, then playing back the two closest ones mixed together.

<li><p>Integrating a train of DC compensated sinc pulses to get a sawtooth wave. Sounds great except that the wave drifts away from zero if you don't get the DC compensation exactly right (which I found to be really tricky). The DC problem can be reduced by adding a bit of leakage to the integrator, but then you lose the low frequencies.</p></li>

<p>I can't justify a complete rewrite to 100% GWT in one go. It is likely that I would migrate parts of the system to GWT gradually. However for consistency I would like to make use of the GWT TabPanel, MenuBar, etc as global interface elements from day one.</p>

<p>As an experiment to see how 'legacy' parts of the system could be incorporated, I have done the following. </p>

<p>The application's main page template now loads a small 'wrapper' GWT module on every page. This GWT module looks for a selection of DIVs in the dynamically generated host page. If the DIV is found, a suitable widget is slotted into place, i.e. menuBar, tabPanel.</p>

<p>A lot of the configuration for the included widgets can also be slotted into the host page as JSON structures. For instance, I have implemented an adapter that dynamically sets up a TabPanel in this way. I've also added some very simple widgets that load remote HTML, etc.</p>

<p>As a prototype, this all appears to work <strong>perfectly</strong> and loads quickly.
However, it seems that GWT apps are really designed to be run from a single host page, not hundreds of dynamically generated ones.</p>

<p>Can anyone highlight any issues that the above approach may run into, particularly as the GWT module increases in size? I would aim to keep the legacy wrapper module intentionally lean. Other functionality would be implemented in separate modules.</p>

<p>How have other people integrated GWT into their front end in a gradual fashion?</p>

<p>Thanks for the replies.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong> - I don't know how to go about doing that :)</p>

<p><strong>Uros</strong> - I was under the impression that it was a singleton class because of <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394239.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> MSDN page. Also, opening the class in the WBEMTest utility shows <a href=""http://img247.imageshack.us/img247/5686/64933271au3.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>The instances dialog shows: ""1 objects"" and ""max. batch: 1"" in those fields and lists ""Win32_OperatingSystem=@""</p>

<p>The ManagementScope is verified as working, so I don't know what's up. I'm a WMI novice, but this seems like one of the simplest use cases!</p>

    App.ref.addChild(_html);
}

<p>And at last, here is my snippet of JavaScript in my <strong>AirRoot.html</strong> file which is trying to call the public method <strong>as3Function()</strong> declared in my Main class:</p>

<pre><code>Exposed.testAs3 = function()
{
    air.trace(""Exposed.testAs3 called"");            /* This works fine. */

    air.trace(""seeing if I can get to AS3 params..."");  /* This works fine. */

    /* This doesn't work - get the following error: TypeError: Value undefined does not allow function calls. */

I'm most concerned about performance, particularly efficiency of indexes.</p>

<p>Let's say you have these representative tables:</p>

<pre><code>Person
------
PersonId int  (PK)
PersonTypeId tinyint  (FK to PersonTypes)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>PersonTypes
-----------
PersonTypeId tinyint
PersonTypeName varchar(50)
</code></pre>

<p>The obvious factors are data size and coding hassle.  When we get to 100 million rows in the person table, we're storing 300 million less bytes with tinyint as opposed to int, plus the space taken up by our indexes.  Not a huge amount of data, but significant if the design decision is applied to dozens of big tables.  The coding hassle, of course, comes from all those casting problems back in the ASP.NET C#/VB code.</p>

<p>If we set aside those two issues, what else comes into play?  Will queries be much more efficient due to the decreased size of the index pages?  Or is there some sort of padding that happens that will just negate the benefits?  Any other gotchas?</p>

<p>I've always just used ints personally, but I'm considering tinyint for an upcoming redesign/migration effort on some huge tables, so I'd love to get some advice.</p>

<p>[Edit]</p>

<p>After experimenting with this, the coding hassles I anticipated turned out to be a non-issue.  Changing from int to tinyint hasn't resulted in any casting problems at all.</p>

When I debug this in Visual Studio, it runs great through the ASP.NET Development Studio.

If you set it high enough, about 30000, it crashes with a segmentation fault just like C.  Although, C seems to go quite a lot higher.</p>

<p>(The Python folks are quick to point out that you can always convert recursive functions to iterative ones and that they're always faster.  That's 100% true.  It's not really what my question is about though.)</p>

<p>I tried the same experiment in Perl and somewhere around 10 million recursions it consumed all of my 4 gigs of ram and I used ^C to stop trying.  Clearly Perl doesn't use the C stack, but it does use a ridiculous amount of memory when it recurses -- not terribly shocking considering how much work it has to do to call functions.</p>

<p>I tried in Pike and was completely surprised to get 100,000,000 recursions in about 2 seconds.  I have no idea how it did that, but I suspect it flattened the recursion to an iterative process -- it doesn't seem to consume any extra memory while it does it. [Note: Pike does flatten trivial cases, but segfaults on more complicated ones, or so I'm told.]</p>

<p>I used these otherwise useless functions:</p>

<pre><code>int f(int i, int l) { if(i&lt;l) return f(i+1,l); return i; }

sub f { return f($_[0]+1, $_[1]) if $_[0]&lt;$_[1]; return $_[0] };

def f(i,l):
   if i&lt;l:
     return f(i+1,l)
   return i
</code></pre>

<p>I'm very curious how other languages (e.g., PHP, Ruby, Java, Lua, Ocaml, Haskell) handle recursion and why they handle it that way.  Additionally, please note whether it makes a difference if the function is ""tail-recursive"" (see comment).</p>

<p>On my 32 bit system I use a <a href=""http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/mpfr/"" rel=""nofollow"">C++ wrapper</a> for the MPFR data type; this wrapper has a constructor defined for <code>long int</code> but not <code>long long int</code>. Nevertheless, on the 32-bit system this code just works:</p>

<pre><code>long long int i=5LL;
mpreal myVar(i);
cout&lt;&lt; ""this was constructed with a long long int:"" &lt;&lt;myVar &lt;&lt;endl;
</code></pre>

<p>How is this possible? Does the 32-bit gcc just somehow cast the <code>long long int</code> into say <code>long int</code> for which the <code>mpreal</code> data type <em>does</em> have a constructor? If the above code is run on 64-bit Linux then the compiler results in an error about the construction being ambiguous.</p>

<p>I know that some people will tell me not to use <code>long long int</code> at all on 64 bit, but unfortunately, I'm using another library (odeint) where this is built in to the code to construct my given multiprecision data type this way, so I don't think I can change things.</p>

<p>Is <code>long long int</code> exactly the same as <code>long int</code> on 64-bit anyway? Will I lose data if I cast to <code>long int</code>? e.g. if I make my own constructor like:</p>

<p>I didn't write this procedure, but may be able to influence a change if there's a really serious problem.</p>

<p>My present problem is that when I add this procedure to my model, the designer generates this function:</p>

<pre><code>[Function(Name=""RetailAdmin.TitleSearch"")]
public int TitleSearch([Parameter(DbType=""VarChar(50)"")] string isbn,  
  [Parameter(DbType=""VarChar(50)"")] string author, 
  [Parameter(DbType=""VarChar(50)"")] string title)
{
    IExecuteResult result = this.ExecuteMethodCall(this, 
        ((MethodInfo)(MethodInfo.GetCurrentMethod())), isbn, author, title);

    return ((int)(result.ReturnValue));
}
</code></pre>

<p>which doesn't look anything like the result set I get when I run the proc manually:</p>

<p>Can anybody tell me what's going wrong here?</p>

<p>This is basically the same problem as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/404186/problem-with-the-return-type-of-a-stored-procedure"">this question</a> but due to the poor phrasing from the OP it was never really answered.</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks Marc for your reply. I will see about making the changes you suggested.</p>

<p>The problem was the temp table. Linq to Sql just doesn't know what to do with them. This was particularly difficult to diagnose, because Visual Studio caches information about stored procs, so when it initially failed to find a result set it set the return as a default integer type and didn't update when I made changes to the stored proc. Getting VS to recognize a change requires you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delete proc from the dbml</li>
<li>delete the server connection from Server Explorer</li>
<li>save the dbml to force a recompile</li>
<li>close the project and restart VS</li>
<li>recreate the server connection and import the proc</li>
</ul>

<p>You might not have to do every one of those steps, but that's what worked for me. What you need to do, if you must use a temp table, is to create a barebones proc that simply returns the correct schema, and then alter it to do what you want after you've imported it into the OR Designer.</p>

<p>Now, because this process by definition always works on files I've just been - and might still be - working on, I'm wondering whether I'll get loads of corrupted / partially updated files in my backup as rsync copies the files while I'm writing to them.</p>

<p>I couldn't find anyhing in the manpage and was yet unsuccessful in googling for the answer. I could go read the source, but that might take quite a while. Anybody know how concurrent file access is handled inside rsync?</p>

<p>The systems are diverse in that multiple operating systems (Linux, Solaris, Windows), Multiple Databases (Several Versions of oracle, sybase and mysql), and even multiple languages (C, C++, JSP, PHP, and a host of others) are used.</p>

<p>Each system is fairly autonomous, even at the cost of entering the same data into multiple systems.</p>

<p>Management recently decided that we should investigate what it will take to get all the systems happily talking to each other and sharing data.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that while we can make software changes to any of the individual systems, a complete rewrite of any one system (or more) is not something management is likely to entertain.</p>

<p>The first thought of several of the developers here was the straight forward:  If system A needs data from system B it should just connect to system B's database and get it.  Likewise if it needs to give B data it should just insert it into B's database.</p>

<p>Due to the mess of databases (and versions) used, other developers were of the opinion that we should have one new database, combining the tables from all the other systems to avoid having to juggle multiple connections.   By doing this they hope that we might be able to consolidate some tables and get rid of the redundant data entry.</p>

<p>This is about the time I was brought in for my opinion on the whole mess.</p>

<p>The whole idea of using the database as a means of system communication smells funny to me.  Business logic will have to be placed into multiple systems (if System A wants to add data to System B it better understand B's rules concerning the data before doing the insert), several systems will most likely have to do some form of database polling to find any changes to their data, continuing maintenance will be a headache, as any change to a database schema now propagates several systems.</p>

<p>My first thought was to take the time and write APIs/Services for the different systems, which once written could be easily used to pass/retrieve data back and forth.  A lot of the other developers feel that is excessive and far more work than just using the database.</p>

<p>So what would be the best way to go about getting these systems to talk to each other?</p>

Does Lucene.Net have built in it the ability to manage concurrent access, or do I have to manage it, to avoid ""being used by another process"" errors?</p>

<p>EDIT:  After reading docs and experimentation, this is what I think I've learned:  There are two issues, thread safety and concurrency.   Multithreading is ""safe"" in that you can't do anything bad to the index.   But, it's safe at the cost of just one object having a lock on the index at one time.   The second object will come along and throw an exception.   So, you can't leave a search open and expect a writer in another thread to be able to update the index.   And if a thread is busy updating the index, then trying to create a searcher will fail.</p>

<p>Also, Searchers see the index as it was at the time that they open it, so if you keep them around, and update the index, they won't see the updates. </p>

<p>I wanted my searchers to see the latest updates. </p>

<p>My design, and it seems to be working so far, is that my writers and searchers share a lock, so that they don't fail - they just wait - until the current write or search is done.</p>

<p>So that the rest of my application does not have to be dependent on this web service, I would like to create my own Location type within my application.  My thought is I could call a method that returns a generic list of my Location type which internally calls the web service and populates the list I return.  That way, if the data source for Locations changes in the future to something other than the web service, I only have to fix the method instead of fixing all the callers.</p>

<p>So I created my own Location that has identical properties as the service Location.  But I don’t seem to be able to cast the array of service locations into a generic list of my locations.  I also tried casting a single service Location into one of my Locations and that didn’t work either.</p>

<p>Is there an implementation of this:</p>

<pre><code>float InvSqrt (float x)
{
   float xhalf = 0.5f*x;
   int i = *(int*)&amp;x;
   i = 0x5f3759df - (i&gt;&gt;1);

<p>in C#?  If it exists, post the code.  </p>

<p>I guess I should have mentioned I was looking for a ""safe"" implementation...  Either way, the BitConverter code solves the problem.  The union idea is interesting.  I'll test it and post my results.</p>

<p>Edit:
As expected, the unsafe method is the quickest, followed by using a union (inside the function), followed by the BitConverter.  The functions were executed 10000000 times, and the I used the System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch class for timing.  The results of the calculations are show in brackets.</p>

<pre><code>Input: 79.67
BitConverter Method: 00:00:01.2809018 (0.1120187)
Union Method: 00:00:00.6838758 (0.1120187)
Unsafe Method: 00:00:00.3376401 (0.1120187)
</code></pre>

<p>For completeness, I tested the built-in Math.Pow method, and the ""naive"" method (1/Sqrt(x)).</p>

<pre><code>Math.Pow(x, -0.5): 00:00:01.7133228 (0.112034710535584)
1 / Math.Sqrt(x): 00:00:00.3757084 (0.1120347)
</code></pre>

<p>The difference between 1 / Math.Sqrt() is so small that I don't think one needs to resort to the Unsafe Fast InvSqrt() method in C# (or any other unsafe method).  Unless one <em>really</em> needs to squeeze out that last bit of juice from the CPU...  1/Math.Sqrt() is also much more accurate.</p>

<p>So I have a test-class extending <code>ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2</code> which contains multiple tests. The code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class ManageProjectsActivityTestextends ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2&lt;ManageProjectsActivity&gt; {
    public ManageProjectsActivityTest() {
        super(""eu.vranckaert.worktime"", ManageProjectsActivity.class);
    }

    @Override
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
        getInstrumentation().getTargetContext().deleteDatabase(DaoConstants.DATABASE);
        super.setUp();
        solo = new Solo(getInstrumentation(), getActivity());
    }

    @Override
    protected void runTest() throws Throwable {
        super.runTest();
        getActivity().finish();
    }

    public void testDefaults() {
        // My test stuff
    }

    public void testAddProject() {
        // My test stuff
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the activity which is under test has a list of projects.
The list of projects is retrieved from the database. And when no database is available, so when the DB is created, I insert one default project.</p>

<p>So that means when the tests are run this is what I exepct:</p>

<ol>
<li>The database, if available, is removed on the device</li>
<li>The first test is started (and thus the activity is launched which creates my DB with one project)</li>
<li>The tests uses the newly created DB, so meaning with only one project, during the test a second project is created</li>
<li>The first test is finished and the setUp() method is called again</li>
<li>The database, that should exist now, is again removed</li>
<li>The second test is started (and thus the activity is launched which creates my DB with one project)</li>
<li>The second test also finishes</li>
</ol>

<p>But that's not quite what this test-suite does...
This is the result of my test-suite:</p>

<ol>
<li>The database, if available, is removed on the device</li>
<li>The first test is started (and thus the activity is launched which creates my DB with one project)</li>
<li>The tests uses the newly created DB, so meaning with only one project, during the test a second project is created</li>
<li>The first test is finished and the setUp() method is called again</li>
<li>The database, that should exist now, is again removed</li>
<li><strong>And here it comes: The second test is started (but my DB is not created again!!! I cannot see a file on the device either...) and the test should display only one project at the beginning but it does display already two!!!</strong></li>
<li>The second test also finishes but fails because I have two projects at the beginning...</li>
</ol>

<p>At the beginning I did not override the runTest() method but I thought that maybe I should end the activity myself to force the re-creation, but it doesn't make any difference.</p>

<p>So it seems that the DB is kept in memory (as even no new DB file is created on the device when I explicitly remove it). Or even the activity, because when putting a breakpoint a in the onCreate of the activity I only get in there once for both tests.</p>

<p>For the maintaining the DB I use ORMLite. You can see my helper class here: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/worktime/source/browse/trunk/android-app/src/eu/vranckaert/worktime/dao/utils/DatabaseHelper.java"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://code.google.com/p/worktime/source/browse/trunk/android-app/src/eu/vranckaert/worktime/dao/utils/DatabaseHelper.java</a></p>

<p>So my question is how to force the tests to use a different DB all the time...?</p>

<p>The repository contains (amongst other things) a List method suitable for paging. The documentation for <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb738474.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Supported and Unsupported Methods</a> does not mention it, but you can't ""call"" <code>Skip</code> on a unordered <code>IQueryable</code>. It will raise the following exception:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>System.NotSupportedException: The method 'Skip' is only supported for
  sorted input in LINQ to Entities. The method 'OrderBy' must be called before
  the method 'Skip'..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I solved it by allowing to define a default sorting via a partial method. But I'm having problems checking if the expression tree indeed contains an <code>OrderBy</code>.</p>

<p>I've reduced the problem to as less code as possible:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class Repository
{
    partial void ProvideDefaultSorting(ref IQueryable&lt;Category&gt; currentQuery);

    public IQueryable&lt;Category&gt; List(int startIndex, int count)
    {
        IQueryable&lt;Category&gt; query = List();
        ProvideDefaultSorting(ref query);
        if (!IsSorted(query))
        {
            query = query.OrderBy(c =&gt; c.CategoryID);
        }
        return query.Skip(startIndex).Take(count);
    }
    public IQueryable&lt;Category&gt; List(string sortExpression, int startIndex, int count)
    {
           return List(sortExpression).Skip(startIndex).Take(count);
    }
    public IQueryable&lt;Category&gt; List(string sortExpression)
    {
        return AddSortingToTheExpressionTree(List(), sortExpression);
    }
    public IQueryable&lt;Category&gt; List()
    {
           NorthwindEntities ent = new NorthwindEntities();
           return ent.Categories;
    }

    private Boolean IsSorted(IQueryable&lt;Category&gt; query)
    {
        return query is IOrderedQueryable&lt;Category&gt;; 
    }
}

public partial class Repository
{
    partial void ProvideDefaultSorting(ref IQueryable&lt;Category&gt; currentQuery)
    {
        currentQuery = currentQuery.Where(c =&gt; c.CategoryName.Contains("" "")); // no sorting..
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is not my real implementation!</p>

<p>But my <strong>question</strong> is, how could I implement the <code>IsSorted</code> method? The problem is that LINQ to Entities query's are always of the type <code>ObjectQuery</code>, which implements <code>IOrderedQueryable</code>.</p>

<p>So how should I make sure an <code>OrderBy</code> method is present in the expression tree? Is the only option to parse the tree?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong><br>
I've added two other overloads to make clear that it's not about how to add sorting support to the repository, but how to check if the <code>ProvideDefaultSorting</code> partial method has indeed added an <code>OrderBy</code> to the expression tree.</p>

<p>The problem is, the first partial class is generate by a template and the implementation of the second part of the partial class is made by a team member at another time. You can compare it with the way the .NET Entity Framework generates the EntityContext, it allows extension points for other developers. So I want to try to make it robust and not crash when the <code>ProvideDefaultSorting</code> is not implemented correctly.</p>

<p>So maybe the question is more, how can I confirm that the <code>ProvideDefaultSorting</code> did indeed add sorting to the expression tree.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong><br>
The new question was answered, and accepted, I think I should change the title to match the question more. Or should I leave the current title because it will lead people with the same problem to this solution?</p>

<p>However these days I find a book such as ""Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture"" (POEA) by Martin Fowler, much more useful in my day to day work.  </p>

<p>In discussions with fellow developers, many make the (fair) point that frameworks like .NET are slowly starting to provide many of the patterns in the GOF book, and so why re-invent the wheel?</p>

<p>It seems many developers think that the GOF book is the only reference worth having on design patterns.  So their logic goes that because frameworks (.NET etc) are providing many GOF patterns for us, patterns have seen their day and are no longer as important.</p>

<p>Surprisingly (to me at least) when I mention the patterns descibed in POEA, I am often met with blank stares.  </p>

<p>POEA proves that patterns are more than just Interators, Singletons, Commands etc.  I would also say that the patterns in GOF are really just a distinct ""category"" of patterns, applicable to a different (non-overlapping) level of design, than those in POEA.  </p>

<p>So, what other ""categories"" of patterns have applied in your development?  What level of design do these patterns apply to?  At what point in the development process are they normally used?  Is there a book or reference for these patterns?</p>

<p>I have an idea for an application that needs to send data between two known phones. The problem is that the data could be very small or very large. I want to have intermediate storage on a server and a messaging layer, but I want there to be performant means to communicate between devices for shorter, unimportant messages.</p>

<p>You always hear about networking and client to client communication with popular platforms and protocols, but I'm curious what people's thoughts are on doing p2p style communication with an iPhone.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure it should (and can) be treated as just a simple addressable machine... so I would have to build NAT traversing network code into the iPhone itself. A thought I had would be some sort of UPnP situation where I would ask to NAT a particular port for communication to the devices... but I guess I could just as easily turn it into a polling situation. </p>

<p>Granted, I understand that Apple will have a ""push"" mechanism for developers eventually but I want to get the app out the door before hand...</p>

<p>Just curious about thoughts on this type of thing... any thoughts on multi-player game situations would also directly apply to (and benefit from) this question.</p>

<p>I'm curious, because allowing sleep to occur at any moment means, from the app's perspective, the system clock could suddenly leap forward by a significant amount.  That's a possibility I don't usually consider while coding.</p>

  Thanks to VonC for some insight.  In most cases, turning off the ""Auto-detect encoding of local file"" checkbox fixes it, although for at least one file, it didn't help.  Also I haven't been able to find a way to do multiple files -- they have to each be changed, one at a time.

The examples all show something like <code>printf(""Username: %s\n"", optarg)</code> in the processing examples. This is great for showing an example, but I want to be able to actually store the values for use later. Much of the rest of the code uses <code>string</code> objects instead of <code>char*</code> so I need to cast/copy/whatever the contents of optarg into a string.</p>

<p>I have a data frame (which for sentimental reasons I like to call my.data) which I want to do a full marginal analysis on. I need to remove certain elements one at a time and 'value' the data frame then I need to do the iterating again by removing only the next element. Then do again... and again... The idea is to do a full marginal analysis on a subset of my data. Anyhow, I can't conceive of how to do this in a vector efficient way. </p>

<p>I've shortened the looping part of the code down and it looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for (j in my.data$item[my.data$fixed==0]) { # &lt;-- selects the items I want to loop 
                                            #     through
    my.data.it &lt;- my.data[my.data$item!= j,] # &lt;-- this kicks item j out of the list

<blockquote>(*5) Design and implement a library for writing event-driven simulations.  Hint: &lt;task.h&gt;.  ... An object of class task should be able to save its state and to have that state restored so that it can operate as a coroutine.  Specific tasks can be defined as objects of classes derived from task.  The program to be executed by a task might be defined as a virtual function.  ... There should be a scheduler implementing a concept of virtual time. ... The tasks will need to communicate.  Design a class queue for that.  ...</blockquote>

<p>I am not sure exactly what this is asking for.  Is a task a separate thread?  (As far as I know it is not possible to create a new thread without system calls, and since this is a book about C++ I do not believe that is the intent.)  Without interrupts, how is it possible to start and stop a running function?  I assume this would involve busy waiting (which is to say, continually loop and check a condition) although I cannot see how that could be applied to a function that might not terminate for some time (if it contains an infinite loop, for example).</p>

I know that 'let' allows the variable to be defined further into a scope without it being used outside of said scope. That is obviously a nice advantage for iterators in for loops. I know this is an ES6 definition, so compiling to ES6 should look nearly identical in terms of 'var' and 'let'. </p>

<p>Anyway, I haven't read much about how well these technologies play together. How easy is it to integrate GWT with Grails on the server-side?

The purpose is to enable or disable an ActionLink based on the AuthorizeAttribute set on the controller/action.

<p>I'm trying out Scons by setting up a basic C++ sample project that has two sub-projects: </p>

<ul>
<li>Prj1 is an EXE that depends on Prj2</li>
<li>Prj2 is a DLL that exports some functions</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem I'm running into is that the library builds its .obj, .pdb, .lib, .dll, etc. files in the same directory as it's SConscript file while the EXE builds its files in the same directory as its SConscript. The application successfully builds both the Prj2 dependency and itself. However, you cannot run the resulting EXE because it can't find the library it needs because it is in the other directory.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>How can I get multiple projects that have dependences to output their binaries and debug information into a common directory so that they can be executed and debugged?</p>

<h2>Potential Solutions</h2>

<p>This is what I have thought of so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>I tried using VariantDir (previously called BuildDir) however this doesn't seem to work. Perhaps I'm messing something up here.</li>
<li>I could potentially tell the compiler and the linker explicitly (via Fo/Fd for example) where to drop their files (is this the best or only solution???)</li>
<li>Execute a copy command on the resulting binaries (this seems like a hack and quite a pain to manage/maintain)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I updated the File Structure and file contents below to reflect the working solution in it's entirety. Thanks to grieve for his insight.</p>

<h2>Command</h2>

<p>With this configuration, you must unfortunately execute the build by cd'ing to the build directory and then running the command below. I need to get a properly working alias setup to get around this.</p>

<p>And the net result of all this is that they're drowning in passwords and accounts. </p>

<p>It seems that if they had a single unified login / single signon service they could go a long way to combining these. E.g.:  ldap as the master repository, radius linked to it for vpn, ejabber and even WPA2 wireless access, plugins for google app sign on, and perhaps an openid server for external websites like highrisehq.</p>

<p>It seems that all these tools exist separately, but does anyone know of a single box that combines them with a nice GUI and auto-updates?  (e.g. like pfsense/m0n0wall for firewalls, freeNAS for storage). It doesn't have to be FOSS. A paid box would be fine too.</p>

<p>I figure this must exist. Microsoft's Active Directory is likely one solution but they'd rather avoid Windows if possible. There seem to be various ""AAA"" servers that ISPs use or for enterprise firewall/router management, but that doesn't seem quite right.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on feedback we’ve changed

  change helps reinforce the purpose of
  views in a MVC application (which are
  intended to be purely about rendering
  and to not contain any non-rendering
  related code), and for most people
  eliminates unused files in the
  project.</p>
  
  <p>The RC build now adds C# and VB syntax
  support for inheriting view templates
  from base classes that use generics. 
  For example, below we are using this
  with the Edit.aspx view template –
  whose “inherits” attribute derives
  from the ViewPage type:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really like being able to write view specific code in the codebehind to just output the view - especially if I have logic repeated in several parts of the page where I cant justify creating a partial view.</p>

<p><strong>My actual question:</strong> Scott said <strong>by default</strong> - which implies I can change that behavior, but i cannot seem to see where. Is it possible? Manually creatingn a codebehind file and changing things around is a pain.</p>

<p>This causes an additional problem too :</p>

<ul>
<li>If I refactor the name of my model then the directive in the View isn't updated. This isn't the end of the world, but one distinct advantage of having it fully strongly typed.
<hr></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> For those of you wondering WHY I would want a codebehind here are some of the possible reasons. This is a cumulative list of just about everything I've thought of. It goes without saying (well it should) that you mustn't access any data other than that which is already in the model. LINQ would be fine for simple manipulation  of model data, but LINQ to SQL would NOT! MVC is for people who should already know this - thats why I love it - made BY smart people FOR smart people.</p>

<ul>
<li>Databinding legacy ASP.NET controls - if an alternative is not available or a temporary solution is needed.</li>
<li>View logic that requires recursion to create some kind of nested or hierarchical HTML.</li>
<li>View logic that uses temporary variables. I refuse to define local variables in my tag soup! I'd want them as properties on the view class at the very least.</li>
<li>Logic that is specific only to one view or model and does not belong to an HtmlHelper. As a side note I don't think an HtmlHelper should know about any 'Model' classes. Its fine if it knows about the classes defined inside a model (such as <code>IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt;</code>, but I dont think for instance you should ever have an HtmlHelper that takes a <code>ProductModel</code>. </li>
<li>HtmlHelper methods end up becoming visible from ALL your views when you type <code>Html+dot</code> and i really want to minimize this list as much as possible.</li>
<li>What if I want to write code that uses <code>HtmlGenericControl</code> and other classes in that namespace to generate my HTML in an object oriented way (or I have existing code that does that that I want to port).</li>
<li>What if I'm planning on using a different view engine in future. I might want to keep some of the logic aside from the tag soup to make it easier to reuse later.</li>
<li>What if I want to be able to rename my Model classes and have it automatically refactor my view without having to go to the view.aspx and change the class name.</li>
<li>What if I'm coordinating with an HTML designer who I don't trust to not mess up the 'tag soup' and want to write anythin beyond very basic looping in the .aspx.cs file.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think people are biased against 'code-behind' since it has traditially been interpreted to mean 'event handling code' as opposed to 'the other half of a view's partial class' which is what it is.</p>

<p>Code-behind for views is just fine.</p>

<ul>
<li>whoever instantiated a given command object and the command object,</li>
<li>the command object and the ""data access"" object (i.e. someone who handles the remote procedure calls over the network to the servers) that the command object calls.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these two callback routes has to be able to be a one-to-one relationship. This is due to the fact that I might have several instances of a given command class running the exact same job at the same time but with slightly different parameters, and I don't want their callbacks getting mixed up. Using events, the default way of handling asynchronicity in AS3, is thus pretty much out since they're inherently based on one-to-many relationships.</p>

<p>Currently I have done this using <strong>callback function references</strong> with specific kinds of signatures, but I was wondering <em>if someone knew of a better (or an alternative) way?</em></p>

<p>Here's an example to illustrate my current method:</p>

<ul>
<li>I might have a view object that spawns a <code>DeleteObjectCommand</code> instance due to some user action, passing references to two of its own private member functions (one for success, one for failure: let's say <code>""deleteObjectSuccessHandler()""</code> and <code>""deleteObjectFailureHandler()""</code> in this example) as callback function references to the command class's constructor.</li>
<li>Then the command object would repeat this pattern with its connection to the ""data access"" object.</li>
<li>When the RPC over the network has successfully been completed (or has failed), the appropriate callback functions are called, first by the ""data access"" object and then the command object, so that finally the view object that instantiated the operation in the first place gets notified by having its <code>deleteObjectSuccessHandler()</code> or <code>deleteObjectFailureHandler()</code> called.</li>

The application is written in Java (Sun JDK 1.6_04). The Linux OOM killer is configured to kill processes when memory usage exceeds 160MB. Even during high load our application never go over 120MB and together with some other native processes that are active we stay well within the OOM limit.</p>

<p>However, it turns out that the Java Runtime.getRuntime().exec() method, the canonical way to execute external processes from Java, has a <a href=""http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/subprocess/subprocess.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">particularly unfortunate implementation on Linux</a> that causes spawned child processes to (temporarily) require the same amount of memory as the parent process since the address space is copied. The net result is that our application gets killed by the OOM killer as soon as we do Runtime.getRuntime().exec().</p>

<p>We currently work around this by having a separate native program do all external command execution and we communicate with that program over a socket. This is less than optimal.</p>

<p>After <a href=""http://aggregat4.net/2008/06/java-runtimeexec-dangerous-on-linux/"" rel=""noreferrer"">posting about this problem online</a> I got some feedback indicating that this should not occur on ""newer"" versions of Linux since they implement the posix fork() method using copy-on-write, presumably meaning it will only copy pages that it needs to modify when it is required instead of the entire address space immediately.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this true?</li>
<li>Is this something in the kernel, the libc implementation or somewhere else entirely?</li>
<li>From what version of the kernel/libc/whatever is copy-on-write for fork() available?</li>

<p>Then one day I found out C++ had changed and now had the STL and templates. I really liked that! Made the language useful. Then another day MS decided to apply facial surgery to VB, and I really hated the end result for the gratuitous changes (using ""end while"" instead of ""wend"" will make me into a better developer? Why not drop ""next"" for ""end for"", too? Why force the getter alongside the setter? Etc.) plus so much Java features which I found useless (inheritance, for instance, and the concept of a hierarchical framework).</p>

<p>And now, several years afterwards, I find myself asking this philosophical question: Is inheritance <strong>really</strong> needed?</p>

<p>The gang-of-four say we should favor object composition over inheritance. And after thinking of it, I cannot find something you can do with inheritance you cannot do with object aggregation plus interfaces. So I'm wondering, why do we even have it in the first place?</p>

<p>Any ideas? I'd love to see an example of where inheritance would be definitely needed, or where using inheritance instead of composition+interfaces can lead to a simpler and easier to modify design. In former jobs I've found if you need to change the base class, you need to modify also almost all the derived classes for they depended on the behaviour of parent. And if you make the base class' methods virtual... then not much code sharing takes place :(</p>

<p>Else, when I finally create my own programming language (a long unfulfilled desire I've found most developers share), I'd see no point in adding inheritance to it...</p>

Moreover Kerberos can be added as plugin to Apache Directory.
But the Kerberos cache stores decrypted tickets (aiming at sharing them with other applications). I would need the crypted version of the ticket to be able to check the user password during an offline session. Conclusion: Kerberos doesn't offer a simple solution to my problem.</p>

<p>Which is the fastest method, and why?</p>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> measuring this reliably is difficult, because <code>import</code> is cached so it can't be executed multiple times in a test. The loading with pickle also gets faster after the first time probably because page-precaching by the OS. Loading 1 million numbers with <code>cPickle</code> takes 1.1 sec the first time run, and 0.2 sec on subsequent executions of the script.</p>

<p>Intuitively I feel <code>cPickle</code> should be faster, but I'd appreciate numbers (this is quite a challenge to measure, I think). </p>

We have tried to use the example from the documentation of client-side Spring-WS, but we end up with a WebServiceTransportException. The XML config looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""webServiceTemplate"" class=""org.springframework.ws.client.core.WebServiceTemplate""&gt;
    &lt;constructor-arg ref=""messageFactory""/&gt;
    &lt;property name=""messageSender""&gt;

<p>We have been able to configure the application programmatically, but this configuration was not possible to ""transfer"" to a Spring XML config because some setters did not use the format Spring expects. (HttpState.setCredentials(...) takes two parameters). The config was lifted from some other Spring-WS client code in the company.</p>

<p>This is the configuration that works:</p>

<pre><code> public List&lt;String&gt; getAll() {
    List&lt;String&gt; carTypes = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();

    try {
        Source source = new ResourceSource(request);
        JDOMResult result = new JDOMResult();


        SaajSoapMessageFactory soapMessageFactory = new SaajSoapMessageFactory(MessageFactory.newInstance());

        WebServiceTemplate template = new WebServiceTemplate(soapMessageFactory);

        HttpClientParams clientParams = new HttpClientParams();
        clientParams.setSoTimeout(60000);
        clientParams.setConnectionManagerTimeout(60000);
        clientParams.setAuthenticationPreemptive(true);

        HttpClient client = new HttpClient(clientParams);
        client.getState().setCredentials(AuthScope.ANY,
                new UsernamePasswordCredentials(""username"", ""password""));

        CommonsHttpMessageSender messageSender = new CommonsHttpMessageSender(client);

        template.setMessageSender(messageSender);
        template.sendSourceAndReceiveToResult(SERVICE_URI,
                source, result);

        // Handle the XML

    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    } catch (SOAPException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }

    return carTypes;
}

conceptually and in practice.</p>

<p>I have also looked at <a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/buckminster/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Buckminster</a> quite extensively (but have not gotten to running samples yet) to try and figure out what it is
and how it compares. The documentation is poor. For instance, they use terminology like Build Automate and Deploy, but I have yet to see anything about deployment. Staged-migration is another hinted-at but un-discussed topic.</p>

<p>Both Maven and Buckminster give you the ability to specify dependencies and generally manage the build, test and possibly deploy processes.</p>

<p>They both have eclipse integration and should both (having only used Maven) trivialize the setup and sharing of eclipse based projects and their dependencies.</p>

<p>The major differences that I can see are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dependencies: </p>

<ul>
<li>Buckminster can specify dependencies living in source repositories and it's own type of repository in addition to being able to reference Maven repositories for dependencies.</li>
<li>Buckminster can group dependencies into virtual distros and is also platform aware. The grouping of software certainly seems possible in Maven with poms that reference other dependecies and group them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Build</p>

<ul>
<li>Maven uses an implicit build system based on layout. It is very easy to create a default project, put things where they are expected to be and have maven build, test and create jars. At the same time, being implicit can also be constricting. You have to live with how Maven does things.</li>
<li>Buckminster - It is not clear to me how Buckminster decides what to build and how to build it. It would seem that this would align with the eclipse process for doing the same. Buckminster also allows the use of ant, but it is not clear if this is a requirement. At the very least, the lifecycle is less (un?) defined for good or bad, allowing more flexibility.</li>
<li>Both tools allow for headless builds, although buckminster may carry a bit more baggage along with it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Plugins</p>

<ul>
<li>Maven has a very extensive set of plugins for all phases of the lifecycle for many different kinds of automation, from code generation to running embedded services for testing.</li>
<li>Buckminster does not appear to have the same concept of plugins. There are readers and actors, but they do not seem to play the same role. Buckminster should have access to the extensive set of plugins available for ant. It is not clear how well ant actions can be seamlessly integrated with the rest of Buckminster processes (this is also an issue for the maven ant plugin).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Deployment</p>

<ul>
<li>Maven has a number of plugins for generating distributions of software (assemblies) and moving them around (wagons). Does Buckminster get all of this from Ant?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Complexity</p>

<ul>
<li>The different schemas for Buckminster can be quite complex, between CPECs RMAPs MSPECs, etc.</li>
<li>Maven is somewhat simpler configuration-wise, although it can get complex with large and multi-module projects. Maven also has Archetypes for easy creation of new projects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Documentation</p>

<ul>
<li>They are both bad. ;-)</li>
<li>Buckminster is very shallow, documentation-wise. Not enough examples are available.</li>
<li>Maven plugins tend to have very poor documentation, making it difficult to get them running correctly.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>From my perspective, most of what I would want to do with Buckminster I can do with Maven. ""Materializing"" from version control is a plus, but developers within an organization can publish maven snapshots to a repository to share with each other, in addition to just providing fixed versions.</p>

<p>There does seem to be more flexibility and freedom from the strictures of the Maven lifecycle (ever wanted to add another phase, like post-test for cleanup? Gotta wait for them to do it in the core).</p>

<p>What am I missing? Is there some major amount of functionality in Buckminster that is worth the step up in complexity?</p>

<p>Are there any wildly innacurate statements above (given that I am not a Buckminster user and only a low-mid level Maven user)?</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do is show a dialog box that asks the user if he/she wants to leave the page if there are unsaved changes. That all works fine. But the problem is described below:</p>

<p>Has anyone come across the problem where Internet Explorer fires the onbeforeunload event twice? While Googling around, I found it has something to do with the fact that for (among others) an ASP.NET linkbutton the HTML code is <code>&lt;a href=""javascript: __doPostBack...</code>. </p>

<p>Apparently, when IE encouters a link that doesn't have a <code>href=""#""</code>, it fires the onbeforeunload event. Then, when you confirm the javascript dialog box we're showing, the page will do the 'real' unload to navigate to the other page, and raise the onbeforeunload event a second time.</p>

<p>A solution offered on the internet is to set a boolean variable and check on it before showing the dialog. So the second time, it wouldn't be shown. That's all well, but when the user cancels, the variable will still be set. So the next time the user wants to leave the page, the dialog won't be shown anymore.</p>

<p>Hope this is a little clear, and I hope someone has found a way around this?</p>

<p>In my application, I need to get those addresses for which the scope is 'Link'. I could have used a system call to ifconfig and then parsed the output to extract corresponding addresses. But the problem is, I'm using the call to getifaddrs(), which returns a linked list of structure ifaddr, given as :</p>

<pre><code>       struct ifaddrs {
           struct ifaddrs  *ifa_next;    /* Next item in list */
           char            *ifa_name;    /* Name of interface */
           unsigned int     ifa_flags;   /* Flags from SIOCGIFFLAGS */
           struct sockaddr *ifa_addr;    /* Address of interface */
           struct sockaddr *ifa_netmask; /* Netmask of interface */
           union {
               struct sockaddr *ifu_broadaddr;
                                /* Broadcast address of interface */
               struct sockaddr *ifu_dstaddr;
                                /* Point-to-point destination address */
           } ifa_ifu;
       #define              ifa_broadaddr ifa_ifu.ifu_broadaddr
       #define              ifa_dstaddr   ifa_ifu.ifu_dstaddr
           void            *ifa_data;    /* Address-specific data */
       };

<p>Is what I wrote above, importing a model from another app and setting it as a foreign key, how Django apps interact? Or is there a different/better method for the apps that comprise a site to interact?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong><br>
Per the recommendation in one response, I'm reading the documentation for contrib.contenttypes. If I'm reading this correctly, I could rewrite my example comment app like this:  </p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models  
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
from django.contrib.contentypes import generic

class comment(models.Model):  
    id = models.AutoField()  
    author = models.CharField(max_length=200)  
    text = models.TextField()  
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType)  
    content_object = generic.GenericForeignKey(content_type, id)  
</code></pre>

<p>Would this be correct?</p>

<ul>
<li><code>@Offset</code> to indicate where the pagination starts,</li>
<li><code>@Limit</code> to indicate the page size,</li>
<li><code>@SortColumn</code> to indicate the column used for sorting purposes,</li>
<li><code>@SortDirection</code>, to indicate ascendant or descendant sorting.</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is to do the pagination on the database, as the result set contains thousands of rows so caching is not an option (and using VIEWSTATE is not even considered as, IMO, sucks).</p>

<p>As you may know SQL Server 2005 provides the function <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186734.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">ROW_NUMBER</a> which <em>returns the sequential number of a row within a partition of a result set, starting at 1 for the first row in each partition</em>.</p>

<p>We need sorting on every returned column (five in this example) and dynamic SQL is not an option, so we have two possibilities: using plenty of <code>IF ... ELSE ...</code> and having 10 queries, which is a hell to maintain, or having a query like the following:</p>

<pre><code>WITH PaginatedOrders AS (

            WHEN 'CustomerID:D' THEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Orders.CustomerID DESC)
            WHEN 'EmployeeID:A' THEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Orders.EmployeeID ASC)
            WHEN 'EmployeeID:D' THEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Orders.EmployeeID DESC)
            WHEN 'OrderDate:A' THEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Orders.OrderDate ASC)

I'm trying to execute a command line statement on a windows box for my PHP web app.  It's running on windows XP, IIS5.1.  The web app is running fine, but I cannot get @exec() to work with a specific contactenated variable.  My command construction looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$cmd = ($config-&gt;svn."" cat "".$this-&gt;repConfig-&gt;svnParams().quote($path).' -r '.$rev.' &gt; '.quote($filename));
</code></pre>

<p>This command does not work as is above, when it generates the following string:</p>

<pre><code>svn --non-interactive --config-dir /tmp cat ""file:///c:/temp/test/acccount/dbo_sproctest.sql"" -r 1 &gt; ""C:\Inetpub\sites\websvn\temp\wsv5B45.tmp""
</code></pre>

<p>If I copy/paste this to my own command line, it works fine.</p>

<p>If I hard code that very same path instead of adding it with the variable, it works!  I've tried with and without quotes around the file name.  I've tried with and without quotes around the entire command.  I've tried other directories.  I've tried passing an output paramter to exec(), and it comes back empty (Array () ).  I've tried redirecting the output of the error stream of the command to a file, and that error output file never gets created. </p>

<p>The only thing I can possibly concieve of is that exec() is failing silently.  What on earth am I doing wrong here?  If I hard code the file path, using the same dir structure and filename, it works fine.  If I don't, it doesn't.</p>

<p>Maybe the slashes () in the file path aren't being escaped properly, but when I do it manually with single quotes they are not considered escape sequences??</p>

<p><em>UPDATE:</em></p>

<p>I took the @ off of exec, and still not seeing any errors.</p>

<p>I gave the full path to SVN, still no luck.  It should be noted that the command worked fine before with the non-full path SVN so long as I manually specify the file destination for cat.</p>

<p><em>Update 2: RE: Kieth</em></p>

<p>I'm calling exec by trying both:</p>

<pre><code>exec($cmd);
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>exec($cmd, $out);
</code></pre>

<p>My php.ini already had safe_mode = 0.</p>

<p>I added error_reporting(E_ALL); and didn't see anything new</p>

<p>If I echo (or print_r) my exec call, I am not actually seing <em>anything</em></p>

<p>If I echo (or print_r) my exec call when included an output var, I get an empty arr</p>

<p><em>Update 3</em></p>

<p>I tried both escapeshellcmd and escapeshellarg to no avail (good idea though).</p>

<p>I should add that the file is being created through invoking</p>

<pre><code>tempnam(""temp"", ""wbsn"");
</code></pre>

<p>The fact that it works just fine if I manually specify the string instead of letting it be generated by tempname seems to suggests that the source of the problem, but I can't figure out how.  I did a comparison of the manual string with the one generated, and it came back as a match.</p>

<p>In my game I have a gameOver method which ends the game and prints a statement to the console. What I would like is to call upon this method when my player sprite ""falls off"" the screen. </p>

<p>Right now I have a rectangle shape placed at the bottom of the screen to represent some kind of hazard (like water) and when the player collides with it, it calls the gameOver method and the game ends.

<pre><code>/** End the game. */
public void gameOver()
{
    world.terminate();
    isOver = true;
}

<p>This is the code (from the 'Enemy' class, similar code is used in a Hazard class also) that ends the game when player collides with an enemy-</p>

<p>How would I approach this in C? Would I just make a char* buffer with a fixed size, and then somehow check when its full and write it to a file with fwrite(), flush it, start over??</p>

<p>the schema: all I have now are some Django models, and that's far too much detail to post here. And if I start posting schemas this becomes too specific, and I was looking for general tips. For example, consider that I issue ""orders"" that will be later processed and return a result that I have to store to display some kind of ""history"". In this case is it better to have a separate table for the ""history"" or just one that aggregates both the ""orders"" and the result? I guess I could cache the ""history"" table, but this would take more space in the database and also more database operations because I would have to constantly create new rows instead of just altering them in the aggregate table.</p>

<pre><code>http://server/application?source=123&amp;destination=234&amp;text=hello
</code></pre>

<p>This request contains the ID of the sender, the ID of the recipient and the text of the message.</p>

<p>This message should be processed like:</p>

<ul>
<li>finding the matching User object for both the source and the destination from the database</li>
<li>creating a tree of objects: a Message that contains a field for the message text and two User objects for the source and the destination</li>
<li>persisting this tree to a database.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tree will be loaded by other applications that I can't touch.</p>

<p>I use Oracle as the backing database and JPA with Toplink for the database handling tasks. If possible, I'd stay with these.</p>

<p>Without much optimization I can achieve ~30 requests/sec throughput in my environment. That's not much, I'd require ~300 requests/sec. So I measured where the performance bottleneck is and found that the calls to <code>em.persist()</code> takes most of the time. If I simply comment out that line, the throughput go well over 1000 requests/sec.</p>

<p>I tried to write a small test application that used simple JDBC calls to persist 1 million messages to the same database. I used batching, meaning I did 100 inserts then a commit, and repeated until all the records was in the database. I measured ~500 requests/sec throughput in this scenario, that would meet my needs.</p>

<p>It is clear that I need to optimize insert performance here. However as I mentioned earlier I would like to keep using JPA and Toplink for this, not pure JDBC.</p>

<p>Do you know a way to create batch inserts with JPA and Toplink? Can you recommend any other technique for improving JPA persist performance?</p>

<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFO:</strong></p>

<p>""requests/sec"" means here: total number of requests / total time from beginning of test to last record written to database.</p>

<p>I tried to make the calls to <code>em.persist()</code> asynchronous by creating an in-memory queue between the servlet stuff and the persister. It helped the performance greatly. However the queue did grow really fast and as the application will receive ~200 requests/second continuously, It is not an acceptable solution for me.</p>

<p>In this decoupled approach I collected requests for 100 msec and called <code>em.persist()</code> on all collected items before commiting the transaction. The EntityManagerFactory is cached between each transaction.</p>

<p>My existing JavaScript in my HTML looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form ...&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find what? &lt;input ...&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=""ButtonArray""&gt;
  &lt;a href=""AddRecord.ASP&amp;amp;Action=ADD""&gt;ADD&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href=""#"" onClick=""return MyFormSubmit();""&gt;FIND&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This displays Buttons for [Add] and [Find].  For Find it is necessary to Submit the form, and I use MyFormSubmit() which validates the data, adds a visual effect to the page, and then POSTs the data.</p>

<p>I could add a CLASS or ID to the  for the Find button and in JQuery I could write something like:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
  $("".MySearchButtonClass"").click(function() {
    // validate and process form here
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>At my ""novice"" stage of understanding with JQuery I don't <em>get</em> why I would do it this way</p>

<p>My old way identifies the Method near the object. There may be a risk that the JS has not loaded before the user presses the button (is there? The LOAD for the JS is right at the top of the page).</p>

<p>The JQuery Document Ready method won't be activated until the document is loaded (which I assume guarantees that the JS is all present and ready to be run?), but it moves the code to a separate part of my HTML file - so when I see the MyButtonArray DIV in the HTML source it isn't obvious to me which objects have methods, and which do not.</p>

<p>Can you please help me understand what my options are and the benefits / gotchas that I should look out for?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I'm comfortable that DOM manipulation - such as a LightBox that can appear when any thumbnail with class ""LightBoxThumb"" is clicked - would use Unobtrusive Javascript.</p>

<p>However I am struggling to persuade myself that a button that has a specific action should have its method applied in that way. (I certainly wouldn't put any code on the button other than a single function call to something ""elsewhere"", but to my mind that is my best clue as to what that button does, and layers of Unobtrusive Javascript may make that much harder to determine.)</p>

<p><strong>Edit2 - Accepted Answer</strong></p>

<p>I've taken Russ Cams answer. It describes Unobtrusive Javascript in a way that has been helpful to me in understanding more about how &amp; when that should be used.</p>

<p>For the moment (may change when I have more experience!) I'll stick with an OnClick event for a single, non-changing, action on an object as I feel that will be easier for me to debug - and diagnose if problems arise. For ZebraStripes on a table that allows click on heading column to sort (and situations of that type) I can see the benefits of the Unobtrusive Javascript approach</p>

<p>Russ's final comment was particularly helpful, repeated here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""@Kristen - You're right, like a lot
  of programming topics, there is more
  than one approach and people will
  vehemently stand by their beliefs! If
  we're talking about a single method
  for a single button, I totally
  understand where you're coming from...</p>
  
  <p>If we're talking about lots of
  JavaScript, with same function calls
  for more than one element, different
  function calls for different methods,
  etc. I think that it would be more
  difficult for oneself to mix inline
  and unobtrusive approaches, and it
  would be better to adopt one or the
  other approach""</p>

<p>This is a two part question:</p>

<p><strong>1.) How is Map data stored?</strong>  - When you have a network of roads, how is this data generally stored?  What parts of the data are retained inorder to reproduce a map later?  Is each road stored as a series of points where it changes direction? What kind of file formats is this data stored in? Are there publically available libraries for easily parsing these files? Does anyone have specifics on how map/road data is stored/represented it would be very helpful.</p>

<p><strong>2.) Navigation/Pathing</strong> - When doing basic pathing on this map data (a la Garmin) is my assumption correct that it is converted to a directed graph?  Is each road intersection a vertex with the edge weights the distance between vertexes?  This is what I was thinking about doing so I could try some basic well known pathing algorithms and see what I get.</p>

<p>I've seen <a href=""http://www.bts.gov/publications/north_american_transportation_atlas_data/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> publically available map data on the US but I'm not sure how it is represented and if it is detailed enough for me to be able to build my directed graph out of it.</p>

I issued the command VACCUM FULL ANALYSE from my client computer (laptop) to my server. It has been going about its business for the last 3-4 days or so; I am wondering if it will end anytime soon for I have much work to do!</p>

<p>The server has a quad-code Xeon 2.66 GHz processor, 12 GB or RAM and a RAID controller attached to 2 x 10K rpm 146 GB SAS HDs in a RAID 1 configuration; it is running Suse Linux. I am wondering...</p>

<p>Now, firstly the VACUUM postmaster process seems to be making use of only one core. Secondly, I am not seeing a very high I/O writes to I/O idle time ratio. Thirdly, from calling <code>procinfo</code>, I can extrapolate that the VACUUM process spends most of its time (88%) waiting for I/0.</p>

<p>So why isn't it utilizing more cores through threads in order to overload the RAID controller (get high I/O writes to idle ratio)? Why is it waiting for I/O if the I/O load isn't high? Why is it not going faster with all this power/resources at its fingers? It seems to me that VACUUM can and should be multithreaded, especially if it is working on a huge table and it is the only one working!</p>

<p>Also, is their a way to configure postgresql.conf to let it multithread such VACUUMs? Can I kill it and still benefit from its partial clean-up? I need to work on that table.</p>

 webapp2/pom.xml    // peer of webapp1 and points to parent.

<p>each of the webapps refers to the parent pom, and they both currently have a jetty maven plugin that works.</p>

<p>My question is how do I mount each of the webapps from the parent pom such that mvn jetty:run works in the parent directory?</p>

<p>edit to anwer: Pascal T
The issue is not so much that I'm getting an error when I try and run the command from the root pom, but that I'm not sure how to configure it.</p>

<p>for example the webapp1/pom.xml 
looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;project&gt;

  &lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.mortbay.jetty&lt;/groupId&gt;

  &lt;/plugin&gt;
&lt;/plugins&gt;
...
&lt;/project&gt;

<p>changing to this directory and typing mvn jetty:run works just fine and affords me the ability to hit: <a href=""http://localhost:8080/webapp1"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://localhost:8080/webapp1</a>.</p>

<p>However, what I would like would be to be in the parent of webapp1, and run all 'n' webapps from the parent directory.  Thus having <a href=""http://localhost:8080/webapp1"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://localhost:8080/webapp1</a>, and <a href=""http://localhost:8080/webapp2"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://localhost:8080/webapp2</a> available with one command line parameter.</p>

<p>I do have mutexes in place to control multi-threaded calls, but I still get the problem.</p>

<p>Is using an object pointer as the callback parameter really a good idea? With no guarantees of synchronisation between the threads, it just smells bad to me.</p>

<p>Is there a better solution? What do other people do?</p>

<p>One thing that occurs is to keep a set of pointers to every single Timer instance (add in constructor, remove in destructor). But I don't think this would work because if Timer is derived from, we'd only remove the pointer from the set in the base class destructor; the damage is already done if we've started destroying the derived object.</p>

<p>Basically what I want is to let the compiler ignore multiple definitions of a certain label and just use the first. In order to do that, I thought I'd just do something like this:</p>

<pre>
    \makeatletter
    \newcommand{\mylabel}[1]{
        \@ifundefined{#1}{\label{#1}}{X}
    }
    \makeatother
</pre>

<p>This does not work though, because the first option is always chosen (it doesn't matter if the label is defined or not). I think the \@ifundefined (and the suggested \ifundefined) only work for commands and not for labels, but I don't really know much about LaTeX. Any help with this would be great! Thanks!</p>

<p>Much later update:
I marked David Hanak's response as the correct answer to my question, but it isn't a complete solution, although it really helped me.
The problem is, I think but I'm no specialist, that even though David's code checks to see if a label is defined, it only works when the label was defined in a previous run (i.e. is in the .aux file). If two \mylabels with the same name are defined in the same run, the second will still be defined. Also, even if you manage to work around this, it will make LaTeX use the first label that you defined chronologically, and not necessarily the first in the text.
Anyway, below is my quick and dirty solution. It uses the fact that counters do seem to be defined right away.</p>

<pre>
\newcommand{\mylabel}[1]{%
    \@ifundefined{c@#1}{%
        \newcounter{#1}%
        \setcounter{#1}{0}%
    }{}%
    \ifthenelse{\value{#1} > 0}{}{%
        \label{#1}%
        \addtocounter{#1}{1}%
    }%
}
</pre>

<p>I'm not sure if it is necessary to initialize the counter to 0, as it seems like a likely default, but I couldn't find if that was the case, so I'm just being safe.
Also, this uses the 'ifthen' package, which I'm not sure is necessary.</p>

  <p>Update: <strong>this specifically has to do with <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks that are being modified at runtime via JavaScript.</strong> The native HTML does render and copy correctly; it's the JavaScript modified version of that HTML which doesn't behave as expected.

<h2>Update - a year later</h2>

<p>A little self-promotion: after using XAMPP for a long time, I began to want things it didn't include. (Support for PDO was a big one - every time I tried to enable pdo and mysqli simultaneously, something crashed.) I eventually worked through the process of installing Apache, PHP, MySQL, and PHPMyAdmin individually, and <a href=""http://sleeplessgeek.blogspot.com/2010/01/setting-up-apache-php-mysql-phpmyadmin.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documented the process with screen shots on my blog.</a></p>

<p>Some of the configuration that I was able to do this way could have been done in XAMPP, but it was only because I had to set things up myself that I discovered new things (like being able to serve files out of c:\whatever instead of c:\program files\apache\htdocs).</p>

<p>On the whole, I'm happier with having installed these items separately. But XAMPP was a good (and easy) package to start with, and served me well while I used it.</p>

The purpose is to use it with jQuery.ui sortable. </p>

<p>Everything is working fine, in fact I can even get the cloning and the appending right. However, it appends it <b>before</b> the closing <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> tag, and for the life of me I can't force it to append <b>after</b> this tag.</p>

<p>This is the HTML Markup:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id=""column-2"" class=""connectedSortable""&gt;

            &lt;div class=""delete""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=""other""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The part we're concerned with is <code>class=""other""</code> which upon being clicked on will duplicate the list item.</p>

<p>This is the jQuery so far:</p>

<pre><code>// This works fine
$("".other"").click(function() {

    // This needs to be set (global) to be used later on in some future code.
    actionTarget = this;        

    // This grabs the whole list item
    var targetStory = $(actionTarget).parent().parent();

    // This clones the list item, as well as appending 
    // that clone to the cloned list item
    $(targetStory).clone().appendTo(targetStory);

})
</code></pre>

<p>This works well, it grabs the list item, clones it, then dumps it on the screen - but in the wrong place :(</p>

<p>And here's the output...</p>

<p>So I have three columns of debug code...the number returned from the generate function, (int)generatedNumber, and (int)generatedNumber  % 2</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CONSIDER providing method <code>Close()</code>, in addition to the <code>Dispose()</code>, if close is standard terminology in the area.</p>
  
  <p>When doing so, it is important that you make the Close implementation identical to <code>Dispose</code> and consider implementing <code>IDisposable.Dispose</code> method explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, following the provided example, I've got this class:</p>

<pre><code>public class SomeClass : IDisposable {
    private SomeDisposable someInnerDisposable;

    public void Open() {
        this.someInnerDisposable = new SomeDisposable();

    void IDisposable.Dispose() {

    public void Close() {

        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing) {
        if (disposing) {

            this.someInnerDisposable = null;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>FxCop doesn't seem to like that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CA1816 : Microsoft.Usage : 'SomeClass.Close()' calls 'GC.SuppressFinalize(object)', a method that is typically only called within an implementation of 'IDisposable.Dispose'. Refer to the IDisposable pattern for more information.</p>
  
  <p>CA1816 : Microsoft.Usage : Change 'SomeClass.IDisposable.Dispose()' to call 'GC.SuppressFinalize(object)'. This will prevent unnecessary finalization of the object once it has been disposed and it has fallen out of scope.</p>
  
  <p>CA1063 : Microsoft.Design : Modify 'SomeClass.IDisposable.Dispose()' so that it calls Dispose(true), then calls GC.SuppressFinalize on the current object instance ('this' or 'Me' in Visual Basic), and then returns.</p>
  
  <p>CA1063 : Microsoft.Design : Rename 'SomeClass.IDisposable.Dispose()' to 'Dispose' and ensure that it is declared as public and sealed.</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I implement the dispose pattern with close method correctly?</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried</p>

<p>but FxCop 1.36 still reports them.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Changing it around as suggested eliminates all but this warning:</p>

This will likely be brought to the attention of stakeholders who are non-technical and with whom I do not have a direct line of communication, so my explanation needs to be in written form.</p>

<p>I have already made an attempt at this write-up.  I gloss over the technical specifics as best I can, give an example of how a race condition would occur in the application, and describe its impact.  I feel I did pretty well, but it's far from perfect.</p>

<p>The problem is, as much as I try to shield the reader from computer science, I have still found it difficult to eliminate phrases like ""threads of execution"" and ""mutual exclusion"" without losing correctness and substance.  The risk is that, with too much hand-waving, these concerns could be dismissed as a made-up boogeyman.</p>

<p>Anyway, my question to you is this:  <strong>How would <em>you</em> explain race conditions to a non-technical audience?</strong>  Would you dare to explain CPU scheduling?  Would you invoke the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem"" rel=""noreferrer"">dining philosophers</a>?</p>

<p>I have a command-line program which uses GNU Readline, primarily for command history (i.e. retrieving previous commands using up-arrow) and some other niceties.  Right now the program's output appears interspersed with the user's input, which sometimes is OK but the output is asynchronous (it comes via a network connection in response to the input commands), and that gets annoying sometimes (e.g. if lines are output when the user is typing new input).</p>

<p>I'd like to add a feature to this program: a separate ""window"" for the output.  I thought about using ncurses for this.  But it appears from the <a href=""http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.faq.html#readline_library"" rel=""noreferrer"">ncurses FAQ</a> that the two libraries are not easy to use together.</p>

<p>I might consider using <a href=""http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Editline</a> or <a href=""http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~mcs/tecla/"" rel=""noreferrer"">tecla</a> instead of Readline, but it's not clear to me if either of those will solve my problem.  I'd also consider using something other than ncurses, including a library which provides both kinds of functionality (text-mode windows and command history), but I don't know what might be best.</p>

<p>Oh, and support for colored text might get bonus points.  I suspect I may be able to do that with Readline, so maybe it's a separate concern, but if a solution to my problem also makes it easy to add a bit of color to the output, so much the better.</p>

<p>However, this call fails with a ADOException with the message ""Invalid attempt to call Read when reader is closed.""</p>

<p>I discovered that the sproc was set to SET NOCOUNT ON so I changed that and now I am getting a different exception...</p>

<p>This error occurs when the sproc call is committed.</p>

<p>Any ideas? 
Thanks, Steve</p>

<p>UPDATE: Some of the issues I discovered to be related to access of the session object across multiple threads, which I had not expected. I was able to clean this up, but haven't had a chance to try the recommendation again of using the Session.Connection object to execute a IDbCommand. That had failed before, but I think that was related to the threading issue as well. I hope to get back to that attempt soon.</p>

In this case, the stack needs to be aligned on 4 byte boundaries only. Yes, some of the MMX/SSE instructions require 16byte alignments, but if that is a requirement of the callee, then it should ensure the alignments are correct. Why burden <strong>every</strong> caller with this extra requirement? This can actually cause some drops in performance because every call-site must manage this requirement. Am I missing something?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> After some more investigation into this and some consultation with some internal colleagues, I have some theories about this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Consistency between the PPC, x86, and x64 version of the OS</li>
<li>It seems that the GCC codegen now consistently does a sub esp,xxx and then ""mov""s the data onto the stack rather than simply doing a ""push"" instruction. This could actually be faster on some hardware.</li>
<li>While this does complicate the call sites a little, there is very little extra overhead when using the default ""cdecl"" convention where the caller cleans up the stack.</li>
</ol>

<p>The issue I have with the last item, is that for calling conventions that rely on the callee cleaning the stack, the above requirements <strong>really</strong> ""uglifies"" the codegen. For instance, what some compiler decided to implement a faster register-based calling style for its own internal use (ie any code that isn't intended to be called from other languages or sources)? This stack-alignment thing could negate some of the performance gains achieved by passing some parameters in registers.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> So far the only real answers have been consistency, but to me that's a bit too easy of an answer. I have well over 20 years experience with the x86 architecture and if consistency, not performance, or something else concrete, is really the reason then I respectfully suggest that is a bit naive for the developers to require it. They're ignoring nearly three decades of tools and support. Especially if they're expecting tools vendors to quickly and easily adapt their tools for their platform (maybe not... it <strong>is</strong> Apple...) without having to jump through several seemingly unnecessary hoops.</p>

<p>I'll give this topic another day or so then close it...</p>

<p>I am working on a site that will allow the user to download very large files (up to and exceeding 100GB)</p>

<p>What is the best way to do this <strong><em>without using FTP</em></strong>.  The end user must be able to download the file from there browser using HTTP.  I don't think Flash or Silverlight can save files to the client so as far as I know they won't cut it.</p>

<p>I'm guessing we will need an ActiveX or Java applet to pull this off.  Something like the download manager that MSDN uses.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a commercial (or free) component that will do that?  We do not want the user to have to install a ""browser wide"" download manager (like GetRight), we want it to only work with downloading on our site. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here is some additional info to help clarify what I'm trying to do.  Most of the files above the 4GB limit would be large HD video files (its for a video editing company).  These will be downloaded by users across the internet, this isn't going to be people on a local network.  We want the files to be available via HTTP (some users are going to be behind firewalls that aren't going to allow FTP, Bittorrent, etc.).  The will be a library of files the end user could download, so we aren't talking about a one time large download.  The will be download different large files on a semi-regular basis.</p>

<p>So far Vault that @Edmund-Tay suggested is the closest solution. The only problem is that it doesn't work for files larger than 4GB (it instantly fails before starting the download, they are probably using a 32bit integer somewhere which is exceeded/overflown by the content length of the file).</p>

<p>The best solution would be a java applet or ActiveX component, since the problem only exist in IE, that would work like the article @spoulson linked to. However, so far I haven't had any luck finding a solution that does anything like that (multipart downloads, resume, etc.).</p>

<p>It looks like we might have to write our own. Another option would be to write a .Net application (maybe ClickOnce) that is associated with an extension or mime type.  Then the user would actually be downloading a small file from the web server that opens in the exe/ClickOnce app that tells the application what file to download.  That is how the MSDN downloader works. The end user would then only have to download/install an EXE once.  That would be better than downloading an exe every time they wanted to download a large file.</p>

<p>For example, let's say I have an Edit action which will redirect the user to an Error action handler and I would like to be able to send custom, detailed error messages to its view. To illustrate it clearer, the flow would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>At the Edit view (say, <a href=""http://localhost/product/edit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://localhost/product/edit</a>), the user submits something nasty</li>
<li>At editAction(), a fail check triggers a redirect to my Error view/action handler (so that my URL would read like <a href=""http://localhost/error/index"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://localhost/error/index</a>)</li>
<li>The Error/index.phtml takes a ""errorMessage"" view variable to display the custom error message, and editAction() needs a means to pass in some value to that ""errorMessage"" view variable</li>

<p>I've read the xscreensaver FAQ ( <a href=""http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/faq.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/faq.html</a> ).</p>

<p>I have a gtk based game program that's cranking out 30 frames/second while mixing several channels of audio, and since it's controlled by a joystick, sometimes ""the"" screensaver will kick in.  I put ""the"" in quotes, because there are at least three different popular screensavers, xscreensaver, gnome-screensaver, and kscreensaver, each with their own unique and klunky methods by which an application might inhibit them.</p>

<p>Has anybody encapsulated the code to inhibit all of these into a <em>fast</em> chunk of code?  Oh, and it has to be GPL compatible.</p>

<p>Currently my code simply whines piteously about the uncooperating screensaver developers if any screensaver is detected and the joystick is in use, and doesn't actually try to do anything other than advise the user to manually disable the screensaver, as the only other thing I can think to do is so incredibly ugly that I simply refuse to do it.</p>

<p>Just wondering if anybody else has run into this, and what they've done, and if they did anything, if it was as ugly as it seems to me it would have to be, or if there's some elegant solution out there...  Seems like maybe synthesizing X events somehow to fool the screensaver into thinking there's some activity might do the trick in a universal way, but I'm really not sure how to do that (and hoping you wouldn't need to be root to do it.)</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hmm, unfortuanately, at least on Fedora core 8, this does not appear to work.</p>

<p>The xdg-screensaver script is there, and seems to be intended to work, it just doesn't actually work.</p>

<p>Once you do ""xdg-screensaver suspend window-id"", where window id is gotten from within the program via </p>

<pre>
xwindow_id = GDK_WINDOW_XWINDOW (GTK_WIDGET (widget)-&gt;window);
</pre>

<p>Or whether the window id is gotten via xprop, and xdg-screensaver run manually, two processes are created:</p>

<pre>
[scameron@zuul wordwarvi]$ ps -efa | grep xdg
scameron  4218     1  0 20:12 pts/2    00:00:00 /bin/sh /usr/bin/xdg-screensaver suspend 0x3a00004
scameron  4223     1  0 20:12 pts/2    00:00:00 /bin/sh /usr/bin/xdg-screensaver suspend 0x3a00004
scameron  4313  3151  0 20:15 pts/1    00:00:00 grep xdg
[scameron@zuul wordwarvi]$ 
</pre>

<p>And they never die, even after the program they are supposedly waiting for dies, and the screensaver is never re-enabled.</p>

<pre>
[scameron@zuul wordwarvi]$ xdg-screensaver status
disabled
[scameron@zuul wordwarvi]$ ls -ltr /tmp | grep xdg
-rw------- 1 scameron scameron    15 2009-01-20 20:12 xdg-screensaver-scameron--0.0
[scameron@zuul wordwarvi]$ 
</pre>

<p>Running xdg-screensaver resume window-id does not resume the screensaver.</p>

<p>To re-enable the screensaver, I have to manually kill them, and manually remove the files it leaves around in /tmp:</p>

<pre>
[scameron@zuul wordwarvi]$ kill 4218 4223
[scameron@zuul wordwarvi]$ rm /tmp/xdg-screensaver-scameron--0.0 
[scameron@zuul wordwarvi]$ xdg-screensaver status
enabled
[scameron@zuul wordwarvi]$ 
</pre>

<p>So, good intentions, but doesn't seem to actually work.</p>

<hr>

<p>No, of course not expecting to run it every frame, but don't want it causing hiccups when it does run, is all.  With my thought of synthesizing X events, I was imagining it would be just often enough to make the screen saver think there was activity.</p>

<p>Looking at xdg-screensaver (which seems to be a shell script that ultimately just does a ""wait"" for my process -- cool) it seems to be made to do just what I want.  I knew I couldn't be the only or first one to face this problem.  </p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>For reasons I won't go in to here, I need to append something to the function by enclosing it in an anonymous function, but the only way I've been able to figure out how to do it is by adding a public function to <strong>MyClass</strong> that takes the callBack function as a parameter and returns the modified version.</p>

<p>Is it possible to make this work when passing the callBack function as a parameter to the class? Attempting to modify the function in this manner when passign it as a parameter seems to only affect the instance of it in within the class, but that doesn't seem like it's a valid assumption since functions are Objects in javascript, and are hence passed by reference.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  as crescentfresh pointed out (and I failed to explain well), I want to modify the callBack function in-place. I'd rather not call a second function if it's possible to do all of this when the class is instantiated.</p>

The samples I've found (SDK's SpeakHere, Zdziarski's and Sadun's books and the one at trailsinthesand.com) all use linear PCM but I'd like a commonly used compressed format instead (no ima4 or whatever the name is...).</p>

<p>(Btw, I do not think an MP3-encoder nor AMR-encoder are available due to licensing issues, but AAC does exist, or???)</p>

<p><strong>Edit/Update:</strong> I stumbled upon the following text in Apple's ""iPhone Application Programming Guide"", 2009-01-06, page 137, section: Recording Audio:<br>
""You can record audio in any of the formats listed in “Preferred Audio Formats in iPhone OS” (page 140)"", and as preferred audio formats on page 140 are: ""For compressed audio when playing one sound at a time, and when you don’t need to play audio simultaneously with the iPod application, use the AAC format packaged in a CAF or m4a file.""<br>
Thus, I interpret that as a clear indication that it is indeed, not only possible, but even preferable, to record audio in AAC format wrapped up in a m4a file, which is just what I want. But still, I am not able to achieve that?!</p>

<p>I would like to implement uniform LBP. This is the definiton given by wikipedia for uniform LBP.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A local binary pattern is called uniform if the binary pattern
  contains at most two bitwise transitions from 0 to 1 or vice versa
  when the bit pattern is traversed circularly. For example, the
  patterns 00000000 (0 transitions), 01110000 (2 transitions) and
  11001111 (2 transitions) are uniform whereas the patterns 11001001 (4
  transitions) and 01010010 (6 transitions) are not. In the computation
  of the LBP labels, uniform patterns are used so that there is a
  separate label for each uniform pattern and all the non-uniform
  patterns are labeled with a single label. For example, when using
  (8,R) neighborhood, there are a total of 256 patterns, 58 of which are
  uniform, which yields in 59 different labels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have written code for LBP but not sure how to convert it to a uniform LBP. Below is the code for LBP.</p>

<pre><code>for i=2:m-1
    for j=2:n-1
        J0=I2(i,j);
        I3(i-1,j-1)=I2(i-1,j-1)&gt;J0;
        I3(i-1,j)=I2(i-1,j)&gt;J0;
        I3(i-1,j+1)=I2(i-1,j+1)&gt;J0; 
        I3(i,j+1)=I2(i,j+1)&gt;J0;
        I3(i+1,j+1)=I2(i+1,j+1)&gt;J0; 
        I3(i+1,j)=I2(i+1,j)&gt;J0; 
        I3(i+1,j-1)=I2(i+1,j-1)&gt;J0; 
        I3(i,j-1)=I2(i,j-1)&gt;J0;
        LBP(i,j)=I3(i-1,j-1)*2^7+I3(i-1,j)*2^6+I3(i-1,j+1)*2^5+I3(i,j+1)*2^4+I3(i+1,j+1)*2^3+I3(i+1,j)*2^2+I3(i+1,j-1)*2^1+I3(i,j-1)*2^0;

    end

<p>I know I can't completely prevent it but I'd at least like the compiler warning to hint to a user that they shouldn't be doing that. If they cast my pointer, then that's their problem.  Is there some combination of const and void and * that will do this? I tried something like:</p>

<pre><code>void myAccessFunc(bool string, const void** p, size_t* len);

<pre><code>const char* s;

<p>and if the user does:</p>

Unfortunately a subset of the functions that I need to access have the exact same names. The best solution I have been able to come up with so far is to use LoadLibrary to load one of the DLLs and explicitly call its methods using GetProcAddress. Is there a way for me to implicitly load both libraries and somehow give the compiler a hint that in one case I want to call OpenApi in DLL A and in the other case I want to call OpenApi in DLL B?</p>

<p>I'm developing my executable in C++ using Visual Studio 2008 and the corresponding C runtime library (msvcr90.dll).</p>

<p>[Edit]</p>

<p>Commenter Ilya asks below what I don't like about the GetProcAddress solution. I don't like it for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>It makes the code more complex. One line of code to call a function is replaced with three lines of code, one to define the function signature, one to call GetProcAddress, and one to actually call the function. </li>
<li>It's more prone to run-time errors. If I misspell the function name or mess up the signature I don't see the error until run-time. Say I decide to integrate a new version of the dll and one of the method names has changed, it will compile just fine and won't have a problem until the actual call to GetProcAddress, which could possibly even be missed in a test pass.</li>

<p>I know about diffusion and it all makes sense up the the point where it states that each column is treated as a polynomial and multiplied modulo over GF(2^8).</p>

<p>BUT..multiplying in GF(2^8). Although the domain is still the same, it is not reversible due to mod.... and it has to be reversible because that is the entire point of it.</p>

<p>As far as the first bit goes, my approach is taking A,B,C and D as the 4 bytes of a column and A1, A2, ..., A8 as the bits and E,F,G and H as the output bytes. I was going to set </p>

<pre><code>E = A1,B2,C3,D4,A5,B6,C7,D8
F = D1,A2,B3,C4,D5,A6,B7,C8
G = C1,D2,A3,B4,C5,D6,A7,B8
H = B1,C2,D3,A4,B5,C6,D7,A8
</code></pre>

<p>And thus it is reversible, one-to-one, linear and distributive</p>

<p>It later states that it can be viewed as a matrix multiplication but as the elements of the matrix must be bytes and output as bytes then each element of the matrix must be modulo 256 and therefore not reversible and non linear.</p>

<p>Here's another example, with a predicate, where the fictitious <code>do</code> operator would really make the code look cleaner. This:</p>

<p>I'm unrepentant about the multiple exit points - the structure is clear. But I'm not happy about the series of near-identical if statements. I've considered making a Map of Strings to Commands:</p>

<p>... then using Reflection to make instances of the appropriate class looked up from the Map.

<pre><code>[DataContract]
public class RequestArray
{
  private int m_TotalRecords;
  private RequestRecord[] m_Record;

  [System.Xml.Serialization.XmlElement]
  [DataMember]
  public RequestRecord[] Record
  {

      m_Record[i] = new RequestRecord();
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is when the client says <code>requestArray.TotalRecords=6;</code> the Record array will be allocated and initialized (I realize that I'm hiding an implementation behind an assignment, this is out of my control).</p>

<p>The problem is that when the client does this, the TotalRecord's set code is not called, breakpoints in the service confirm this as well. Rather, some sort of generic setter has been generated that is called instead. How do I get the client to use my setter instead?</p>

<p>EDIT:
It looks like I didn't quite get how the [DataContract] works, but it makes sense that the client wouldn't be executing this code. Like I mentioned in a comment, if I 'manually' do the work of the setter, I see that the set code does get executed right when I call the service function.</p>

<p>The serialization I'm still uncertain on. The contents of the RequestRecord[] array are not getting carried over. The Record class has setters/getters, I feel like I need a helper function somewhere to help it serialize the whole class.</p>

<p>I've considered the use of a custom allocator and placement new to place a regular STL container into a shared memory segment. (like this ddj <a href=""http://www.ddj.com/cpp/184401639;jsessionid=XH553SW4YIE42QSNDLPSKHSCJUNN2JVN?_requestid=537362"" rel=""noreferrer"">article</a>). The problem is that STL containers will internally have pointers to the memory they own. Therefore, if the shared memory segment or memory mapped file loads at a different base address (perhaps on a subsequent run, or in a second process), then the internal pointers are suddenly invalid. As far as I can figure out, the custom allocator approach only works if you can always map the memory segment into your process at the same address. At least with memory mapped files, I have lots of experience of that NOT being the case if you just let the system map it where ever it feels like.</p>

<p>I've had some thoughts on how to do this, but I'd like to avoid it if someone else has already done the work (that's me, being lazy).</p>

<p>I'm currently leaving locking out of the discussion, as the best locking strategy is highly application dependent.</p>

<p>I'm trying to read a file that is located in another machine as a shared resource:</p>

<pre><code>\\remote-machine\dir\MyFileHere.txt
</code></pre>

<p>When I run a standalone application ( a 16 lines java file ) everything is just fine. But when I attempt to read the same file with using the same class and the same method from a server ""engine"" ( this is an application engine, pretty much like a Java EE Application Server where you can run java programs )  the ""FileNotFoundException"" is thrown.</p>

<p>I though I would be some sort of permissions, so I map the resource as a drive: K:\</p>

<p>Re-run my java file, reads, fine.</p>

<p>Re-run my java file inside the ""engine"" -> FileNotFoundException.</p>

<p>When I copy the file into the local machine ( C:\MyFileHere.txt ) no exception is thrown.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>What may be causing this FileNotFoundExcecption? </p>

<p>I'm using Java 1.5</p>

<p>As far as I know the engine pretty much uses java transparently. </p>

<p>Anyone has faced something similar?</p>

<p>Additional question? What would be a good approach for workaround this? I'm starting to think about a tomcat installation serving those files and read them through http, but I think that's too much, that's why the SMB protocol is for in first place isn't it? And probably I won't be able to open sockets anyway.</p>

<p>Does security manager may be the cause ( I have never used that before, but I know it exists ) </p>

<p>Wound't a SecurityException be thrown instead if that would be the case? </p>

<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Solved. Thank you Steve W.</p>

<p>It turns out that this engine is launched with ""LaunchAnywhere"" from ZeroG. So, a .exe is created that in turn will run a JVM with the specified app. </p>

<p>This application it self is Launcher. When it start the engine, somehow ( I cannot figure out why or how ) the user that owns the JVM process is SYSTEM. AS Steve pointed out, this user doesn't have NETWORK access, and thus cannot read from a shared resource or a mapped drive. </p>

<p>The workaround ( while I report this to the manufacturer ) is to create a .cmd file to lauch manually the engine. Since it would be manually launched the user does have access to the network.</p>

<p>I've used ""Process Explorer"" from SysInternals to know exactly the command line used to run the engine app.</p>

The class I'm testing creates a dependency property dynamically at runtime and the type of that dependency property can vary depending on the circumstances. While writing my unit tests, I need to create the dependency property with different types and that leads to errors because you can't redefine an existing dependency property.</p>

<p>So is there any way to either un-register a dependency property or to change the type of an existing dependency property?</p>

<hr>

<p>OverrideMetadata() only lets you change a very few things like default value so it isn't helpful. The AppDomain approach is a good idea and might work but seems more complicated than I really wanted to delve into for the sake of unit testing.</p>

<p>I never did find a way to unregister a dependency property so I punted and carefully reorganized my unit tests to avoid the issue. I'm getting a bit less test coverage, but since this problem would never occur in a real application and only during unit testing I can live with it.</p>

When you click on a message in the tree the new message body is loaded into a <strong>div</strong> near the top of the page using AJAX and then the following code is run:</p>

<pre><code>window.location.hash = ""page_top"";

<p>Of course ""page_top"" is an anchor element near the top of the page, so the newly loaded message body scrolls into view.</p>

<p>This works fine on all the browsers, except Safari. On Safari (tested on PC and iPhone) it only works the first time you set <strong>location.hash</strong>. If you set it again the page does not scroll.</p>

<p>The end result is that the newly loaded message body does not scroll into view in Safari and you have to scroll back to the top of the page every time you pick a new message from the tree.</p>

<p>Why does Safari not like this and is there anything I can do to fix it ?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I'm guessing this is related to a bug that you can find by Googling about location.hash and Safari. It seems Safari used to have a bug where if you set the hash to the same value twice it would cause it to reload the page. I'm guessing when they fixed that bug they fixed it a little too thoroughly and stopped it doing anything when you set hash to the same value again.</p>

  catch (SmtpException ex)
  {
    throw ex;
  }
  catch (Exception ex)
  {
    throw ex;
  }

  // Return the List of failed recipient e-mail addresses, so the client can maintain its list.

<p>Could trust be an issue here?</p>

<p>Another theory: SQL Server and SSRS was installed in the security context of Local System. Am I right, or is this service account restricted access to any network resource? Even its own SMTP Server?</p>

<p>I think I'm cleaning up all form objects etc and calling FinalReleaseComObject() appropriately, but I guess there are references somewhere that are holding my process open.  Is there any way to work out what it is that's stopping my app from closing gracefully?</p>

<p>Anyway, I have written a small bouncing ball program in Java to try and expand my basic skills. The program is just a simple bouncing ball that will drop and <em>hopefully</em> bounce for a while. The original program worked fine but now I have tried to add gravity into the program. The gravity actually works fine for a while but then once the bounces get really small the animation becomes erratic for a very short time then the position of the ball just constantly decreases. I've tried to figure out the problem but I just can't see it. Any help would be most welcome.</p>

<pre><code>public final class Ball extends Rectangle {
float xspeed = 1.0f; float yspeed = 1.0f; float gravity = 0.4f;


public Ball(float x, float y, float width, float height) {
    super(x, y, width, height);
}

public void update(){
    yspeed += gravity;

    move(xspeed, yspeed);

    if(getX() &lt; 0){
        xspeed = 1;
    }
    if(getX() + getWidth() &gt; 320){

<p>EDIT: Thanks that seems to have sorted the erratic movement. I'm still struggling to see how I can stop my ball moving down when it has stopped bouncing. Right now it will move stop bouncing then continue moving down passed the ""floor"". I think it's to do with my yspeed += gravity line. I just can't see how I'd go about stopping the movement down.</p>

<ol>
<li>Serve many clients with each thread, and use nonblocking I/O and level-triggered readiness notification</li>
<li>Serve many clients with each thread, and use nonblocking I/O and readiness change notification</li>
<li>Serve many clients with each server thread, and use asynchronous I/O</li>
<li>serve one client with each server thread, and use blocking I/O</li>
<li>Build the server code into the kernel </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I would appreciate a hint on which should be used <strong>in CPython</strong>, which we know has some good points, and some bad points. I am mostly interested in performance under high concurrency, and yes a number of the current implementations are too slow.</p>

<p>So if I may start with the easy one, ""5"" is out, as I am not going to be hacking anything into the kernel.</p>

<p>""4"" Also looks like it must be out because of the GIL. Of course, you could use multiprocessing in place of threads here, and that does give a significant boost. Blocking IO also has the advantage of being easier to understand.</p>

<p>And here my knowledge wanes a bit:</p>

<p>""1"" is traditional select or poll which could be trivially combined with multiprocessing.</p>

<p>""2"" is the readiness-change notification, used by the newer epoll and kqueue</p>

<p>""3"" I am not sure there are any kernel implementations for this that have Python wrappers.</p>

<p>So, in Python we have a bag of great tools like Twisted. Perhaps they are a better approach, though I have benchmarked Twisted and found it too slow on a multiple processor machine. Perhaps having 4 twisteds with a load balancer might do it, I don't know. Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>Authlogic</h2>

<p>The most advanced authentication solution seems to be <a href=""http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Authlogic</a>.  It supports OpenID with <a href=""http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic_openid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Authlogic OpenID plugin</a>.  It supports Rails 4 and 3. Rails 2 is supported in the rails2 branch.</p>

<p>The easiest way (besides .ToString().Length) is:</p>

<pre><code>(int)Math.Truncate(Math.Log10(x)) + 1;
</code></pre>

<p>However that performs rather poorly. Since my application only sends positive values, and the lengths are rather evenly distributed between 2 and 9 (with some bias towards 9), I precomputed the values and have if statements:</p>

<pre><code>static int getLen(long x) {
    if (x &lt; 1000000) {
        if (x &lt; 100) return 2;
        if (x &lt; 1000) return 3;
        if (x &lt; 10000) return 4;
        if (x &lt; 100000) return 5;
        return 6;
    } else {
        if (x &lt; 10000000) return 7;
        if (x &lt; 100000000) return 8;
        if (x &lt; 1000000000) return 9; 
        return (int)Math.Truncate(Math.Log10(x)) + 1; // Very uncommon
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This lets the length be computed with an average of 4 compares. </p>

<p>So, are there any other tricks I can use to make this function faster?</p>

<p>Edit: This will be running as 32-bit code (Silverlight).</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>I took Norman's suggestion and changed the ifs around a bit to result in an average of only 3 compares. As per Sean's comment, I removed the Math.Truncate. Together, this boosted things about 10%. Thanks!</p>

The one thing I'm missing is an easy way to duplicate the functionality of AS2's MovieClip.onReleaseOutside. It is almost always necessary to implement this event, otherwise you get funny bugs like flash thinks your mouse is down when really it's up. </p>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/2/langref/migration.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AS2 to AS3 Migration Guide</a>, I'm supposed to use <code>flash.display.InteractiveObject.setCapture()</code> for this, however it does not exist as far as I can tell. I guess this document is out of date or incorrect. I've found a few posts on the web about how to duplicate this functionality, but they either have their own problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.arpitonline.com/blog/?p=33"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This one</a> triggers onReleaseOutside even if there was no corresponding onPress event. </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.kirupa.com/forum/showpost.php?p=1948182&amp;postcount=204"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This one</a> seems very inefficient, you'll add and remove an event listener every time the mouse is clicked anywhere inside your app.</li>
</ul>

<p>There has to be an easier way, don't tell me Adobe forgot about this when rewriting Actionscript?</p>

<p>Example AS2 code:</p>

<pre><code>// Assume myMC is a simple square or something on the stage

myMC.onPress = function() {
  this._rotation = 45;
}

myMC.onRelease = myMC.onReleaseOutside = function() {
  this._rotation = 0;
}

<p>Without the onReleaseOutside handler, if you pressed down on the squre, dragged your mouse outside of it, and released the mouse, then the square would not un-rotate, and appear to be stuck.</p>

<p>My handler calculates and sets an entity-tag (using the SetETag method on the HttpCachePolicy associated with the current response object). If I set the cache-control to public using the SetCacheability method everything works like a charm and the server sends along the e-tag header. If I set it to private the e-tag header will be suppressed.</p>

<p>Maybe I just haven't looked hard enough but I haven't seen anything in the HTTP/1.1 spec that would justify this behavior. Why wouldn't you want to send E-Tag to browsers while still prohibiting proxies from storing the data?</p>

<pre>
Cache-Control: public

<p>I've run this on the ASP.NET development server and IIS6 so far with the same results. Also I'm unable to explicitly set the ETag using</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: It's possible to append the ETag header manually when running in IIS7, I suspect this is caused by the tight integration between ASP.NET and the IIS7 pipeline.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification</strong>: It's a long question but the core question is this: <strong>why does ASP.NET do this, how can I get around it and should I?</strong></p>

I found that if you want to emulate the HttpCacheability.Private fully you can set the cacheability to ServerAndPrivate but you also have call cache.<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpcachepolicy.setomitvarystar.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SetOmitVaryStar</a>(true) otherwise the cache will add the <strong>Vary: *</strong> header to the output and you don't want that.

After you have a valid book, you can elect to make it a book which will go into the ObservableCollection of Books. The problem that I'm having is that each item of the ListBox is a ListBox that has an ItemSource that is a Book, that is an ObservableCollection of Cards.

"387702","1","388211","","2008-12-22 23:06:07","","20","6743","<p>Here's a scenario.  You have a large amount of legacy scripts, all using a common library.  Said scripts use the 'print' statement for diagnostic output.  No changes are allowed to the scripts - they range far and wide, have their approvals, and have long since left the fruitful valleys of oversight and control.</p>

<p>Now a new need has arrived: logging must now be added to the library.  This must be done automatically and transparently, without users of the standard library needing to change their scripts.  Common library methods can simply have logging calls added to them; that's the easy part.  The hard part lies in the fact that diagnostic output from these scripts were always displayed using the 'print' statement.  This diagnostic output must be stored, but just as importantly, processed.  </p>

<p>As an example of this processing, the library should only record the printed lines that contain the words 'warning', 'error', 'notice', or 'attention'.  The below Extremely Trivial and Contrived Example Code (tm) would record some of said output:</p>

<pre><code>sub CheckPrintOutput
{
    my @output = @_; # args passed to print eventually find their way here.
    foreach my $value (@output) {
         Log-&gt;log($value) if $value =~ /warning|error|notice|attention/i;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>(I'd like to avoid such issues as 'what should actually be logged', 'print shouldn't be used for diagnostics', 'perl sucks', or 'this example has the flaws x y and z'...this is greatly simplified for brevity and clarity. )</p>

<p>The basic problem comes down to capturing and processing data passed to print (or any perl builtin, along those lines of reasoning).  Is it possible?  Is there any way to do it cleanly?  Are there any logging modules that have hooks to let you do it?  Or is it something that should be avoided like the plague, and I should give up on ever capturing and processing the printed output?</p>

<p>Additional: This must run cross-platform - windows and *nix alike.  The process of running the scripts must remain the same, as must the output from the script.</p>

<p>Additional additional: An interesting suggestion made in the comments of codelogic's answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can subclass <a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/IO/Handle.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://perldoc.perl.org/IO/Handle.html</a> and create your 
    own file handle which will do the logging work. – Kamil Kisiel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This might do it, with two caveats:</p>

<p>1)  I'd need a way to export this functionality to anyone who uses the common library.  It would have to apply automatically to STDOUT and probably STDERR too.</p>

<p>2)  <a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/IO/Handle.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">the IO::Handle</a> documentation says that you can't subclass it, and my attempts so far have been fruitless.  Is there anything special needed to make sublclassing IO::Handle work?  The standard 'use base 'IO::Handle' and then overriding the new/print methods seem to do nothing.</p>

<p>Final edit: Looks like IO::Handle is a dead end, but Tie::Handle may do it.  Thanks for all the suggestions; they're all really good.  I'm going to give the Tie::Handle route a try.  If it causes problems I'll be back!</p>

<p>Addendum: Note that after working with this a bit, I found that Tie::Handle will work, if you don't do anything tricky.  If you use any of the features of IO::Handle with your tied STDOUT or STDERR, it's basically a crapshoot to get them working reliably - I could not find a way to get the autoflush method of IO::Handle to work on my tied handle.  If I enabled autoflush before I tied the handle it would work.  If that works for you, the Tie::Handle route may be acceptable.</p>

<p><code>cpp-markdown</code> has a base class called <code>Token</code>, which has a number of subclasses. Two of the main subclasses are <code>Container</code> (which holds collections of other <code>Token</code>s) and <code>TextHolder</code> (used as a base class for <code>Token</code>s that contain text, of course).</p>

<p>Most of the processing is handled via virtual functions, but some of it was better handled in a single function. For that, I ended up using <code>dynamic_cast</code> to down-cast the pointer from a <code>Token*</code> to one of its subclasses, so I could call functions that are specific to the subclass and its child classes. There's no chance the casting would fail, because the code is able to tell when such a thing is needed via virtual functions (such as <code>isUnmatchedOpenMarker</code>).</p>

<p>There are two other ways I could see to handle this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create <em>all</em> of the functions that I want to call as virtual functions of <code>Token</code>, and just leave them with an empty body for every subclass except the one(s) that need to handle them, or...</p></li>
<li><p>Create a virtual function in <code>Token</code> that would return the properly-typed pointer to <code>this</code> when it's called on certain subtypes, and a null pointer if called on anything else. Basically an extension of the virtual function system I'm already using there.</p></li>

<p>I am working on setting up a method for my company's developers to share documentation and information about our various internal systems. This would range from information that would be useful for bringing a new employee up to speed, to descriptions of common problems users have with the systems and their resolutions.</p>

<p>This seemed like an ideal job for a wiki to me, and since our company only has the ability to host ASP.NET applications, I set about researching the available ASP.NET wikis. <a href=""http://www.screwturn.eu/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ScrewTurn Wiki</a> seemed to be the most appropriate one, it's very full-featured and there are several plugins available that would be useful for my situation, including syntax highlighting and AD integration.</p>

<p>However, upon starting the process to have ScrewTurn deployed to our intranet, it was suddenly remembered that, hey, Sharepoint 2007 has a wiki, and since we already have Sharepoint set up, couldn't we just use that? I did a bit of evaluation of the Sharepoint ""wiki"" (in quotes because it barely qualifies), and was able to demonstrate that it wouldn't be suitable due to its many deficiencies, which I won't list here.</p>

<p>Now at this point, it's been suggested that perhaps I don't need a wiki at all, couldn't we just do everything in Word documents and use Sharepoint's document management functionality instead?</p>

<h3>The actual question</h3>

<p>So what I'm looking for is some additional ammunition, preferably from people with experience. What are examples of things that will be difficult or impossible with Sharepoint in the context of internal developer documentation? What is a wiki better at? Hey, I'm open-minded, what is Sharepoint better at?</p>

<p><strong>What will make it worthwhile to deploy a wiki instead of simply using what we already have?</strong></p>

<pre><code>System.Speech.AudioFormat.SpeechAudioFormatInfo synthFormat = 
                        new System.Speech.AudioFormat.SpeechAudioFormatInfo(System.Speech.AudioFormat.EncodingFormat.Pcm, 
                            8000, 16, 1, 16000, 2, null); 
</code></pre>

<p>This states that the audio is in PCM format, 8000 samples per second, 16 bits per sample, mono, 16000 average bytes per second, block alignment of 2.</p>

<p>When I attempt to execute the following code there is nothing written to my MemoryStream instance; however when I change from 8000 samples per second up to 11025 the audio data is written successfully.</p>

<pre><code>SpeechSynthesizer synthesizer = new SpeechSynthesizer(); 
waveStream = new MemoryStream(); 

PromptBuilder pbuilder = new PromptBuilder(); 
PromptStyle pStyle = new PromptStyle(); 

pStyle.Emphasis = PromptEmphasis.None; 
pStyle.Rate = PromptRate.Fast; 
pStyle.Volume = PromptVolume.ExtraLoud; 

pbuilder.StartStyle(pStyle); 
pbuilder.StartParagraph(); 
pbuilder.StartVoice(VoiceGender.Male, VoiceAge.Teen, 2); 
pbuilder.StartSentence(); 
pbuilder.AppendText(""This is some text.""); 
pbuilder.EndSentence(); 
pbuilder.EndVoice(); 
pbuilder.EndParagraph(); 
pbuilder.EndStyle(); 

synthesizer.SetOutputToAudioStream(waveStream, synthFormat);  
synthesizer.Speak(pbuilder); 
synthesizer.SetOutputToNull(); 
</code></pre>

<p>There are no exceptions or errors recorded when using a sample rate of 8000 and I couldn't find anything useful in the documentation regarding SetOutputToAudioStream and why it succeeds at 11025 samples per second and not 8000. I have a workaround involving a wav file that I generated and converted to the correct sample rate using some sound editing tools, but I would like to generate the audio from within the application if I can.</p>

<p>One particular point of interest was that the SpeechRecognitionEngine accepts that audio format and successfully recognized the speech in my synthesized wave file...</p>

<p>Update: Recently discovered that this audio format succeeds for certain installed voices, but fails for others. It fails specifically for LH Michael and LH Michelle, and failure varies for certain voice settings defined in the PromptBuilder.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;messages&gt;
  &lt;item&gt;
    &lt;important_tag&gt;&lt;/important_tag&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;
  &lt;item&gt;

    &lt;tag2&gt;&lt;/tag2&gt;

    &lt;tag2&gt;&lt;/tag2&gt;
    &lt;tag3&gt;&lt;/tag3&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/messages&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is that <code>&lt;important_tag&gt;</code> will have a specific definition AND it may or may not appear under <code>&lt;item&gt;</code>. It may also appear more than once.
Additionally, there may be other tags before or after <code>&lt;important_tag&gt;</code> that I can not name in advance.</p>

<p>I would like to give a specific definition for <code>&lt;important_tag&gt;</code>. For example, define attributes that it must contain.
What I mean is that <strong>if</strong> important_tag is present it must conform to my definition. Any other tag doesn't have to conform to any definition.</p>

<p>I tried using the following scheme:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""&gt;
  &lt;xs:element name=""messages""&gt;
    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xs:element ref=""item"" maxOccurs=""unbounded""/&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
  &lt;xs:element name=""item""&gt;
    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xs:element ref=""important_tag"" minOccurs=""0""/&gt;
        &lt;xs:any minOccurs=""0""/&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
  &lt;xs:element name=""important_tag""&gt;
    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
      &lt;xs:simpleContent&gt;
        ... specific definitions for important_tag ...
      &lt;/xs:simpleContent&gt;
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This results in an error saying that the schema is ambiguous.</p>

<p>The exact error message is: </p>

<pre><code>cos-nonambig: '&lt;xs:element ref=""important_tag""&gt;' makes the content model non-deterministic against '&lt;xs:any&gt;'. Possible causes: name equality, overlapping occurrence or substitution groups.

<p>I'd like to switch over to using a distributed system (probably git) to make it easier to branch and to work from home. (Both of which are perfectly possible with Perforce, but the git workflow has some advantages.) So although ""tributary development"" would be distributed and not refer to a common revision sequencing, we'd still maintain a master git repo that all changes would need to feed into before a build was created.</p>

<p>What's the best way to preserve strictly increasing build ids? The most straightforward way I can think of is to have some sort of post-commit hook that fires off whenever the master repo gets updated, and it registers (the hash of) the new tree object (or commit object? I'm new to git) with a centralized database that hands out ids. (I say ""database"", but I'd probably do it with git tags, and just look for the next available tag number or something. So the ""database"" would really be .git/refs/tags/build-id/.)</p>

<p>This is workable, but I'm wondering if there is an easier, or already-implemented, or standard/""best practice"" way of accomplishing this.</p>

<p>When I issue the <strong><code>gem update</code></strong> command on Windows, whenever it gets to a
gem whose latest version DOESN'T have Windows binaries, it'll attempt to
build the native extension which will, of course, fail. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Updating sqlite3-ruby

operable program or batch file.
</code></pre>

<p>The old pre-1.x behavior of asking for the required platform at least
made updating possible. Now I can't update at all unless I uninstall the
troublesome gems (currently sqlite3-ruby and hpricot), run the update,
then re-install the gems using the --version switch.</p>

<p>The User Control is itself part of an MVP application (its the View and has an associated Presenter etc). The Presenter is always started first, and it starts the Model(s) and then View(s). The View builds its UI, part of which will be to NEW the UC, which is the View.</p>

<p>Now the (form) Presenter needs to know about the UC Presenter, but I'm thinking that it doesn't know anything about how the View is composed. The form Presenter doesn't, for instance, know that the UC is part of the form's Controls collection, nor should it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the design experience should not be changed; IOW the dev of the View (form) should just be able to select a User Control from the toolbox and drop it on a form.</p>

<p>So, on to my questions. Firstly, are my assumptions above correct? Somewhat misguided? Messed up? WTF are you thinking? </p>

<p>Secondly, is it right (enough?) to have the form View invoke the UC View, and the form Presenter invoke the UC Presenter and have some mechanism to tell the UC View what its Presenter is? This breaks my ""Presenter first"" rule, but I'm not sure how else to do it. </p>

"599184","1","652700","","2009-03-01 03:21:02","","3","6760","<p>I have Joomla 1.5.9 running with php 5.2.8, mySQL 5.1.31 on IIS7 on a vista 64 dev box. I have both SEO Settings ""Search Engine Friendly URLs"" and ""Use Apache mod_rewrite"" working correctly.</p>

<p>I'm also setting up a hosted site (with www.mochahosting.com). They use slightly older versions of the same software: Joomla 1.5.5, php 5.2.6, mySQL 5.0.4x. They also use IIS7, but running on Windows 32. </p>

<p>I can't get either of the SEO settings to work <strong>on the hosted site</strong> (I have gotten the SEO settings to work on my local machine, with pretty much the same configuration). Let's start with ""Search Engine Friendly URLs"" only to keep things simple.</p>

<p>Also, I don't yet have a domain name, so I use a hosts file alias to get to the site. I don't expect anyone to go through that trouble to answer my question, so I'll just describe the issue and hope I do a good enough job that people can understand what's going on. I'll use <a href=""http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx</a> as the base URL (i.e., the joomla home page) for the purpose of this question. Yes, this does imply that Joomla is installed in a subdirectory -- I'm not sure if this is a problem or not (it's not a problem on my dev box).</p>

<p>On to the problem.</p>

<p>Turning on ""Search Engine Friendly URLs"" causes <a href=""http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx</a> to generate a 404 (""Component not found""). In the 404 error page there is a link that goes to  <a href=""http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx/index.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx/index.php</a> -- and that link works. If I turn off ""Search Engine Friendly URLs"" then both <a href=""http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx</a> and <a href=""http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx/index.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx/index.php</a> work. So it seems that turning on ""Search Engine Friendly URLs"" causes the ""automatic redirecting"" of <a href=""http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx</a> to <a href=""http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx/index.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx/index.php</a> to stop working...</p>

<p>Now, if I go to <a href=""http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx/index.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx/index.php</a> and from there navigate to the various main menu links (I'm only using the default joomla site that gets installed with a new Joomla instance), then everything works fine. It's just going to <a href=""http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx</a> that doesn't work. It's worth noting that the ""home"" link that's in the main menu goes to <a href=""http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://nodomainyet.com/joomla156_mx</a> by default.</p>

<p>I've compared the output of phpinfo on the host to that of my dev box and couldn't see any differences that would cause this issue...</p>

<p>Turning on the second SEO setting -- ""Use Apache mod_rewrite"" -- does not solve the problem (one would think that it might, since the purpose of that setting is to get rid of index.php in the URL).</p>

<p>The ""Search Engine Friendly URLs"" usually seems pretty trivial to get to work -- it doesn't require a web.config and rewrite rules... I'm not sure what could possibly cause it to go wrong.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update - 2009-03-03</strong></p>

<p>I thought maybe it was a bad idea to only turn on the first SEO setting (""Search Engine Friendly URLs"") from (""Use Apache mod_rewrite"") (even though I can just turn on ""Search Engine Friendly URLs"" by itself on my local machine and it works fine). So I tried a few more experiments</p>

<p>I thought perhaps the problem was that URL rewriting wasn't setup properly in IIS7 on the host. I did the (first) test file described in <a href=""http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/461/creating-rewrite-rules-for-the-url-rewrite-module"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/461/creating-rewrite-rules-for-the-url-rewrite-module</a> and that worked -- so that means URL rewriting is working.</p>

<p>Then I thought perhaps the problem is that the rewrite rules that one sees everywhere for Joomla on IIS7 need to be rewritten to take into account the subdirectory. Like I said above, the SEO settings are working fine on my local machine. Joomla is also installed in a subdirectory, and everything is working fine. Nevertheless, I tried to modify the rewrite rule from </p>

<pre><code>&lt;rewrite&gt;
    &lt;rules&gt;
        &lt;rule name=""Imported Rule 1"" enabled=""true""&gt;
            &lt;match url=""(.*)"" ignoreCase=""false"" /&gt;
            &lt;conditions logicalGrouping=""MatchAll""&gt;
                &lt;add input=""{REQUEST_FILENAME}"" matchType=""IsFile"" negate=""true"" pattern="""" ignoreCase=""false"" /&gt;
                &lt;add input=""{REQUEST_FILENAME}"" matchType=""IsDirectory"" negate=""true"" pattern="""" ignoreCase=""false"" /&gt;
                &lt;add input=""{SCRIPT_NAME}"" negate=""true"" pattern=""^/index.php"" ignoreCase=""false"" /&gt;
                &lt;add input=""{SCRIPT_NAME}"" pattern=""(/|\.php|\.html|\.htm|\.feed|\.pdf|\.raw|/[^.]*)$"" /&gt;
            &lt;/conditions&gt;
            &lt;action type=""Rewrite"" url=""index.php"" /&gt;
        &lt;/rule&gt;
    &lt;/rules&gt;
&lt;/rewrite&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>to </p>

<pre><code>&lt;rewrite&gt;
    &lt;rules&gt;
        &lt;rule name=""Imported Rule 1"" enabled=""true""&gt;
            &lt;match url=""(.*)"" ignoreCase=""false"" /&gt;
            &lt;conditions logicalGrouping=""MatchAll""&gt;
                &lt;add input=""{REQUEST_FILENAME}"" matchType=""IsFile"" negate=""true"" pattern="""" ignoreCase=""false"" /&gt;
                &lt;add input=""{REQUEST_FILENAME}"" matchType=""IsDirectory"" negate=""true"" pattern="""" ignoreCase=""false"" /&gt;
                &lt;add input=""{SCRIPT_NAME}"" negate=""true"" pattern=""^/joomla156mx/index.php"" ignoreCase=""false"" /&gt;
                &lt;add input=""{SCRIPT_NAME}"" pattern=""(/|\.php|\.html|\.htm|\.feed|\.pdf|\.raw|/[^.]*)$"" /&gt;
            &lt;/conditions&gt;
            &lt;action type=""Rewrite"" url=""joomla156mx/index.php"" /&gt;
        &lt;/rule&gt;
    &lt;/rules&gt;
&lt;/rewrite&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(i.e., prepending the directory name to the condition and action). That didn't make a difference. Now, I'm completely new to rewrite rules so I might have screwed up something.</p>

<p>I guess I find it kind of suspicious that there is no redirect rule; meaning if I copy &amp; paste a 're-written' URL, does't something have to tell the server that is a made-up URL, and it should be redirected to a real URL? But, again, this is all working fine on my local box with plain old rewrite rules, so I may be barking at the wrong tree.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>To store such objects, JPA+Hibernate creates ""Entry"" table, ""Comment"" table and SINGLE ""Entry_Comment"":</p>

<p><code>create table Entry_Comment (Entry_id integer not null, postMortemComments_id integer not null, pmnr integer not null, descriptionComments_id integer not null, dnr integer not null, primary key (Entry_id, dnr), unique (descriptionComments_id), unique (postMortemComments_id))</code></p>

<p>I have a list of Objects I want to iterate over, and then check their subobjects.</p>

<p>Recursive:</p>

<pre><code>doFunction(Object)

{
   //doStuff

<p>I want to change it to something like this</p>

<pre><code>doFunction(Object)
iIterator = hashSet.iterator();
while(Iterator.hasNext()
{
   //doStuff
   hashSet.addAll(Object.subObjects);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Sorry for the poor psuedo code, but basically I want to iterate over subobjects while appending new objects to the end of the list to check.</p>

<p>I could do this using a list, and do something like</p>

<pre><code>while(list.size() &gt; 0)
{
   //doStuff
   list.addAll(Object.subObjects);
}

<p>But I would really like to not add duplicate subObjects.
Of course I could just check whether list.contains(each subObject) before I added It.</p>

<p>But I would love to use a Set to accomplish that cleaner.</p>

<p>So Basically is there anyway to append to a set while Iterating over it, or is there an easier way to make a List act like a set rather than manually checking .contains()?</p>

<p>Any comments are appreciated.</p>

In <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/251696/best-way-to-readset-ie-options"">another question</a> we determined that, in general, it is not prudent to have visibility to client IE settings.  Would this qualify as an exception?</p>

<p>The reason I'd like to do this is that some functions won't work unless the site is being accessed as a trusted site (e.g. client-side sendmail -- don't ask), and I'd like to be able to warn users.  Despite many warnings in the pages, many users still don't read, and send us nastygrams.  We'd like to reduce the email volume by detecting this condition and flashing a big warning that basically says ""<strong>You didn't read the warnings, and what you're trying to do won't work until you change your settings!</strong>""  Any ideas are welcome.</p>

<p>EDIT: In our shop, client-side sendmail only works if the site is trusted, and I can't change that due to security requirements, nor can I switch to server-side sendmail.  However, this is not the only reason that client-side sendmail will fail, so I can't simply catch a sendmail error to determine this.  Also, I don't want this to degrade to a sendmail discussion.</p>

I want it to be like Word 2003, where you can add multiple toolstrips to the same row and have them show up in line with each other, rather than dedicating a row to each toolstrip.</p>

<p>So I added a ToolStripPanel and docked it to the top of the form (I didn't use a ToolStripContainer because I don't need all the extra panels; I just need the one at the top).  I added both toolstrips and set their Stretch properties to False.  I can get them to show up in the designer window side-by-side, but at runtime the ToolStripPanel separates the toolstrips and gives each toolstrip its own dedicated row.  As if to add insult to injury, when i stop debugging and return back to the designer, I am finding that the designer is moving the toolstrips to their own row as well!  Am I doing something wrong here?  </p>

<p>I have been Googling all day and found some information about a ToolStripPanelRow object, but I don't see an easy way to add toolstrips to it (i.e. it doesn't have a ToolStripPanelRow.Controls.Add method or anything like that), all it has is a Controls() property that returns an Array of control objects, and I haven't had much luck trying to add items to that array.  I also found some documentation on the ToolStripPanel.Join method, which sounds like it should do the job, so I tried all 3 overloads but they don't work as advertised.  No matter what I do or which options I try, it always adds the new toolstrip to the top of the panel on its own row and pushes everything else down.  </p>

<p>In the interests of full disclosure I should warn you that I have the ToolStripPanel and one of the toolstrips added to a baseclass form, and I am trying to add the other toolstrip to a subclass form that inherits from the baseclass form.

<ul>
<li>We have applications and DLLs built
with VC6 and a new application built
with VC9. The VC9-app has to use
DLLs compiled with VC6, most of
which are written in C and one in
C++.</li>
<li>The C++ lib is problematic due to
name decoration/mangling issues.</li>
<li>Compiling everything with VC9 is
currently not an option as there
appear to be some side effects.
Resolving these would be quite time
consuming.</li>
<li>I can modify the C++ library, however it must be compiled with VC6.</li>
<li>The C++ lib is essentially an OO-wrapper for another C library. The VC9-app uses some static functions as well as some non-static.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the static functions can be handled with something like</p>

<pre><code>// Header file
class DLL_API Foo
{
    int init();
}

extern ""C""
{
    int DLL_API Foo_init();
}

// Implementation file
int Foo_init()
{
    return Foo::init();
}
</code></pre>

<p>it's not that easy with the non-static methods.</p>

<p>As I understand it, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/232926/how-to-make-consistent-dll-binaries-across-vs-versions#232959"">Chris Becke's</a> suggestion of using a COM-like interface won't help me because the interface member names will still be decorated and thus inaccessible from a binary created with a different compiler. <em>Am I right there?</em></p>

<p>Would the only solution be to write a C-style DLL interface using handlers to the objects or am I missing something?
In that case, I guess, I would probably have less effort with directly using the wrapped C-library.</p>

<p><strong>More Edits:</strong> Performance wise using a locked float for 5.000.000 += operations with 100 threads on my machine takes 3.6s, while my atomic float even with its silly do-while takes 0.2s to do the same work. So the >30x performance boost means its worth it, (and this is the catch) if its correct.</p>

<p><strong>Even More Edits:</strong> As Awgn pointed out my <code>fetch_and_xxxx</code> parts were all wrong. Fixed that and removed parts of the API I'm not sure about (templated memory models). And implemented other operations in terms of operator += to avoid code repetition</p>

<p><strong>Added:</strong> Added operator *= and operator /=, since floats wouldn't be floats without them. Thanks to Peterchen's comment that this was noticed</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Latest version of the code follows (I'll leave the old version for reference though)</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that I haven't ever seen an Access report that would be pretty enough to display to upper management.  I think the output still has to be a PowerPoint presentation.  It needs to look as close as possible to the original output.</p>

<p>I am currently trying to write some code to use a .pot (presentation template) and fill in the data programmatically.  Putting the data into a PowerPoint table has been tricky because the tables are not easy to manipulate.  For example, if a particular description is too long, I need to break into the next cell down (word-wrap isn't allowed because I can only have <em>n</em> lines per page).</p>

<p>Is there a way to make an Access report pretty, am I headed down the right path, or should I just try to programmatically fill in the Excel spreadsheet and use the code that already exists there to produce the presentation?  (I'd still need to figure out how to know when to break a line when using a non-monospaced font, as the users are currently doing that manually when they enter the data in the spreadsheet)</p>

<p>Jason Z:
If I set it to wrap, and I already have <em>n</em> lines, it would make <em>n</em>+1 or 2 lines on the slide, which is unacceptable.</p>

<ol>
<li>To which extent can a strong-named assembly be verified to avoid tampering?</li>
<li>Is it possible to use strong-naming to verify an assembly author?</li>

<p>The first question arises after reading the CSharp411 article <em><a href=""http://www.csharp411.com/net-assembly-faq-part-3-strong-names-and-signing/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">.NET Assembly FAQ – Part 3 – Strong Names and Signing</a></em>, which mentions this, among other problems of using strong names:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""<strong><em>Cannot Stop Full Replacement.</strong> Strong names cannot prevent a hacker from removing the strong name signature, maliciously modifying your assembly, re-signing it with his own key, and then passing off his assembly as yours.</em>""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second question intends to find the differences between strong naming and other signing schemes like, say, <a href=""http://www.iss.net/security_center/advice/Countermeasures/Authentication/Authenticode/default.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Authenticode</a>. The same MSDN article mentioned early states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""<em>Note, however, that strong names in and of themselves do not imply a level of trust like that provided, for example, by a digital signature and supporting certificate.</em>""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I trying to use strong-naming for much more than it was created for? Was strong-naming created just to avoid name clashes or a new kind of ""GAC DLL Hell""?</p>

<li>The checks done in 1. are mainly to avoid a server round trip when the user makes a mistake.</li>
<li>Since they are done on the client side in javascript, you can't trust that they were run. Validating these values again will stop some malicious attacks.</li>

But the problem is, i cant use this code:</p>

<pre><code>Response.ContentType = ""APPLICATION/OCTET-STREAM"";

        // initialize the http content-disposition header to
        // indicate a file attachment with the default filename
        // ""myFile.txt""

            Response.WriteFile(downloadFile.FullName);
            HttpContext.Current.ApplicationInstance.CompleteRequest();
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Because i need to let the user download 3 files so the header cannot cary it, what i tought was getting the file names and open a popup, list the file names with a linkbutton, and then the user can download it.</p>

<p>For each file i create a linkbutton at runtime and add this code :</p>

<pre><code>lnkProblem.Text = ""Problemler dosyası"";
    lnkProblem.Visible = true;
    lnkProblem.Command += new CommandEventHandler(lnkUser_Command);
    lnkProblem.CommandName = Request.QueryString[""fileNameProblems""];
    lnkProblem.CommandArgument = Request.QueryString[""fileNameProblems""];
</code></pre>

<p>Then use this function to make it download by the user : </p>

<pre><code>void lnkUser_Command(object sender, CommandEventArgs e)
{
    Response.ContentType = ""APPLICATION/XML"";

    System.String disHeader = ""Attachment; Filename=\"""" + e.CommandArgument.ToString() +
       ""\"""";
    Response.AppendHeader(""Content-Disposition"", disHeader);
    FileInfo downloadFile = new FileInfo(Server.MapPath(""."") + ""\\xmls\\"" + e.CommandArgument.ToString());
    if (downloadFile.Exists)
    {
        Response.WriteFile(Server.MapPath(""."") + ""\\xmls\\"" + e.CommandArgument.ToString());
        HttpContext.Current.ApplicationInstance.CompleteRequest();
    }
    HttpContext.Current.ApplicationInstance.CompleteRequest();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Application creates the xml file but somewhere of it, app puts the html tags in that xml file so i can't open the file, is there anyway to do this? Maybe any other example...</p>

I have a reference to a div which contains the form elements.

<p>I want to do something like this:</p>

<p>However, the <a href=""http://prototypejs.org/api/element/down"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Element.down</a> method seems to pick the first textarea node, even though there is an input node before the textarea.  </p>

<p>Is there an elegant way around this?  I suppose I could get all the descendants of the parent div, and then iterate over each one looking for one of these nodes, but I suspect that there might be a cool way to do this in prototype.</p>

<p>I can't use the methods of the Form object, because this parent div is only part of the form.  It is added to the page via an AJAX call, so when the div has been added to the DOM, I want to set focus on the first field in the newly added set (which is most likely not the first field in the whole form).</p>

Would it require a custom driver or something on the WinMo device??

<p>and return the following using Split:
    H3Y5NC8E

    2NVAQ4E0</p>

<p>I validate each character against a specific character set (note that the letters 'I', 'O', 'U' &amp; 'W' are absent), so using string.Split is not an option. The number of characters in each group can vary and the number of groups can also vary. I am using the following expression:</p>

<pre><code>([ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTVXYZ0123456789]{8}-?){3}
</code></pre>

<p>This will match exactly 3 groups of 8 characters each. Any more or less will fail the match.
This works insofar as it correctly matches the input. However, when I use the Split method to extract each character group, I just get the final group. RegexBuddy complains that I have repeated the capturing group itself and that I should put a capture group around the repeated group. However, none of my attempts to do this achieve the desired result. I have been trying expressions like this:</p>

<pre><code>(([ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTVXYZ0123456789]{8})-?){4}
</code></pre>

<p>But this does not work.</p>

<p>Since I generate the regex in code, I could just expand it out by the number of groups, but I was hoping for a more elegant solution. </p>

<hr>

<p>Please note that the character set does not include the entire alphabet. It is part of a product activation system. As such, any characters that can be accidentally interpreted as numbers or other characters are removed. e.g. The letters 'I', 'O', 'U' &amp; 'W' are not in the character set.</p>

<p>The hyphens are optional since a user does not need top type them in, but they can be there if the user as done a copy &amp; paste.</p>

<p>With 'somevalue' standing for a user-generated string, int or decimal. Now, the second list is pretty similar, except the id-values are always empty, as they have not been assigned yet.</p>

<p>As we can see I have the value=""#{filterListener.chosenFilters}"". The dataTable's value is also the same, so whenever I click one of the selectItem's the dataTable has an element added or removed from it (this is working). In my backing bean I have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>public class requestFilterListener implements ValueChangeListener {

    private List&lt;String&gt; chosenFilters;

    public requestFilterListener() {
    }

    public void processValueChange(ValueChangeEvent event) {
        System.out.println(""processValueChange called"");
        if (chosenFilters != null) {
            System.out.println(chosenFilters.size());
        }
    }

    public List&lt;String&gt; getChosenFilters() {
        return chosenFilters;
    }

    public void setChosenFilters(List&lt;String&gt; chosenFilters) {
        this.chosenFilters = chosenFilters;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Everytime I click one of the checkboxes, a column is added/removed with the proper data, in my console I get the message ""processValueChange called"" as I output in the processValueChange method, but during this time chosenFilters is always null, and the if expression is never run. How come? This is a session bean, and I really dont understand why my list cant be used within the backing bean, but is used without a problem by my dataTable.</p>

<p>The two databases are similar, and share many of the same tables, but they are not 100% the same. Many of the tables on both sides are very specific to either the internal or external application.</p>

<p>So the question is: when a user updates their information or submits a record on the public website, how do you transfer that data to the internal application's database so it can be managed by the internal staff? And vice versa... how do you push updates made by the staff back out to the website?</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that the more ""real time"" these updates occur, the better. Not that it has to be instant, just reasonably quick.</p>

<p>So far, I have thought about using the following types of approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bi-directional replication</li>
<li>Web service interfaces on both sides with code to sync the changes as they are made (in real time).</li>
<li>Web service interfaces on both sides with code to asynchronously sync the changes (using a queueing mechanism).</li>
</ol>

<p>Any advice? Has anyone run into this problem before? Did you come up with a solution that worked well for you?</p>

<p>When you maximize the application on a different screen than your main one, the location and size (before you maximized) gets stored correctly, but when it is maximized (according to its previous state) it is maximized on my main monitor.

<p>So my question is... how can I make a form, when it is maximized, remember what screen it was maximized on? And how do I restore that when the form opens again?</p>

<hr>

<h2>Kind of complete solution to problem</h2>

<p>I accepted the answer which had a very good tip about how to if on screen. But that was just part of my problem, so here is my solution:</p>

<p><strong>On load</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>First get stored <code>Bounds</code> and <code>WindowState</code> from whatever storage.</li>
<li>Then set the <code>Bounds</code>.</li>
<li>Make sure <code>Bounds</code> are visible either by <code>Screen.AllScreens.Any(ø =&gt; ø.Bounds.IntersectsWith(Bounds))</code> or <code>MdiParent.Controls.OfType&lt;MdiClient&gt;().First().ClientRectangle.IntersectsWith(Bounds)</code>.

<ul>
<li>If it doesn't, just do <code>Location = new Point();</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Then set window state.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>On closing</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Store <code>WindowState</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>WindowState</code> is <code>FormWindowState.Normal</code>, then store <code>Bounds</code>, otherwise store <code>RestoreBounds</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>And thats it! =)</p>

<h2>Some example code</h2>

<p>So, as suggested by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/57488/oliver"">Oliver</a>, here is some code. It needs to be fleshed out sort of, but this can be used as a start for whoever wants to:</p>

<h3>PersistentFormHandler</h3>

<p>Takes care of storing and fetching the data somewhere.</p>

    /// &lt;param name=""defaultWindowBounds""&gt;Default bounds of the window.&lt;/param&gt;

<p><strong>Note 1:</strong> In the load method you have to look for previously stored <code>WindowState</code>, <code>WindowBounds</code> and other values. We use SQL Server, and have a <code>Window</code> table with columns for <code>Id</code>, <code>Name</code>, <code>MachineName</code> (for <code>Environment.MachineName</code>), <code>UserId</code>, <code>WindowState</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, <code>Height</code>, <code>Width</code>. So for every window, you would have one row with <code>WindowState</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, <code>Height</code> and <code>Width</code> for each user and machine. In addition we have a <code>WindowValues</code> table which just has a foreign key to <code>WindowId</code>, a <code>Key</code> column of type <code>String</code> and a <code>Value</code> column of type <code>Binary</code>. If there is stuff that is not found, I just leave things default and return false.</p>

<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> In the save method you then, of course do the reverse from what you do in the Load method. Creating rows for <code>Window</code> and <code>WindowValues</code> if they don't exist already for the current user and machine.</p>

<h3>PersistentFormBase</h3>

<p>This class uses the previous class and forms a handy base class for other forms.</p>

<pre><code>// Should have been abstract, but that makes the the designer crash at the moment...
public class PersistentFormBase : Form
{
    private PersistentFormHandler PersistenceHandler { get; set; }

    private bool handlerReady;

    protected PersistentFormBase()
    {
        // Prevents designer from crashing
        if (LicenseManager.UsageMode != LicenseUsageMode.Designtime)
        {
            Load += persistentFormLoad;
            FormClosing += persistentFormFormClosing;
        }
    }

    protected event EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt; ValuesLoaded;
    protected event EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt; StoringValues;

    protected void StoreValue&lt;T&gt;(string key, T value)
    {
        if (!handlerReady)
            throw new InvalidOperationException();
        PersistenceHandler.Set(key, value);
    }

    protected T GetValue&lt;T&gt;(string key)
    {
        if (!handlerReady)
            throw new InvalidOperationException();
        return PersistenceHandler.Get&lt;T&gt;(key);
    }

    protected T GetValue&lt;T&gt;(string key, T fallback)
    {
        if (!handlerReady)
            throw new InvalidOperationException();
        return PersistenceHandler.Get(key, fallback);
    }

    private void persistentFormLoad(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Create PersistenceHandler and load values from it
        PersistenceHandler = new PersistentFormHandler(GetType(), (int) FormWindowState.Normal, Bounds);
        PersistenceHandler.Load();
        handlerReady = true;

        // Set size and location
        Bounds = PersistenceHandler.WindowBounds;

        // Check if we have an MdiParent
        if(MdiParent == null)
        {
            // If we don't, make sure we are on screen
            if (!Screen.AllScreens.Any(ø =&gt; ø.Bounds.IntersectsWith(Bounds)))
                Location = new Point();
        }
        else
        {
            // If we do, make sure we are visible within the MdiClient area
            var c = MdiParent.Controls.OfType&lt;MdiClient&gt;().FirstOrDefault();
            if(c != null &amp;&amp; !c.ClientRectangle.IntersectsWith(Bounds))
                Location = new Point();
        }

        // Set state
        WindowState = Enum.IsDefined(typeof (FormWindowState), PersistenceHandler.WindowState) ? (FormWindowState) PersistenceHandler.WindowState : FormWindowState.Normal;

        // Notify that values are loaded and ready for getting.
        var handler = ValuesLoaded;
        if (handler != null)
            handler(this, EventArgs.Empty);
    }

    private void persistentFormFormClosing(object sender, FormClosingEventArgs e)
    {
        // Set common things
        PersistenceHandler.WindowState = (int) WindowState;
        PersistenceHandler.WindowBounds = WindowState == FormWindowState.Normal ? Bounds : RestoreBounds;

        // Notify that values will be stored now, so time to store values.
        var handler = StoringValues;
        if (handler != null)
            handler(this, EventArgs.Empty);

        // Save values
        PersistenceHandler.Save();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And thats pretty much it. To use it, a form would just inherit from the PersistentFormBase. That would automatically take care of bounds and state. If anything else should be stored, like a splitter distance, you would listen for the <code>ValuesLoaded</code> and <code>StoringValues</code> events and in those use the <code>GetValue</code> and <code>StoreValue</code> methods.</p>

<p>Hope this can help someone! Please let me know if it does. And also, please provide some feedback if there is anything you think could be done better or something. I would like to learn =)</p>

<p>The problem is that the Navigated event never fires, unless I pop a MessageBox.Show() in the method that told it to .Navigate().   I shall explain:</p>

<pre><code>ThreadStart ts = new ThreadStart(GetLandingPageContent_ChildThread);
Thread t = new Thread(ts);
t.SetApartmentState(ApartmentState.STA);
t.Name = ""Mailbox Processor"";
t.Start();

<p>This works fine; but the messagebox will get in the way since this is an automation app. When I remove the MessageBox.Show(), the WebBrowser.Navigated event never fires.  I've tried supplanting this line with a Thread.Sleep(), and by suspending the parent thread.</p>

<p>Once I get this out of the way, I intend to Suspend the parent thread while the WebBrowser is doing its job and find some way of passing the resulting HTML back to the parent thread so it can continue with further logic.</p>

<p><em>Why does it do this? How can I fix it?</em></p>

<p>If someone can provide me with a way to fetch the content of a web page, fill out some data, and return the content of the page on the other side of the submit button, all against a webserver that doesn't support POST verbs nor passing data via QueryString, I'll also accept that answer as this whole exercise will have been unneccessary.</p>

<p>So, I saw an example of an object function (for Javascript) where you assign a new value and that value gets assigned as that property's actual value. Example:</p>

<pre><code>function Meat (name, color, price) {
    function newPrice (new_price) {

 this.name = name;
 this.color = color;

 this.newprice = newPrice;

<p>Fine and dandy. Now I have the ability to assign a price by using Bacon.price or Bacon.newprice.  Personally, this seems like the highest order of semantics, since functionally it does the same thing. But as an advocate for semantic coding, I'll let it slide. Here's what I want:</p>

<p>When I change the value of Bacon.price, the object should include a function to store the old value in a property called oldprice automatically.  I played around with this, but got nowhere. Here's what I've tried so far:</p>

<pre><code>function Meat (name, color, price) {
    function oldPrice () {
        this.oldprice = this.price;
    }
 this.name = name;
 this.color = color;
 this.oldprice = oldPrice;
 this.price = price;
 }

///////////////////////

function Meat (name, color, price) {
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
    this.oldprice = this.price;
    this.price = price;
}
</code></pre>

<p>More or less variations of that. I thought that referring to the already assigned value (which would be nothing the first time) before the new value got assigned would be enough. I know that the value (or lack thereof) is stored somewhere before it gets assigned, I just don't know how to refer to it to assign it to the oldvalue property before it gets wiped out.</p>

<hr>

<p>Okay, maybe the problem is with my eyes or fingers then. Because I thought I had tried the suggestions before asking (I know, I didn't mention them!)  Unless I'm really confused, this should work:</p>

<pre><code>function Meat(price)
{

    function setPrice(price)
    {
        this.oldprice = this.price;
        this.price = price;
    }

this.price=setPrice;
}

bacon = new Meat()
bacon.price = ""Expensive"";
document.write(bacon.price+""&lt;br /&gt;"");
document.write(bacon.oldprice+""&lt;br /&gt;"");
bacon.price = ""Cheap"";
document.write(bacon.price+""&lt;br /&gt;"");
document.write(bacon.oldprice+""&lt;br /&gt;"");
</code></pre>

<p>But the output I get is:
    Expensive
    undefined
    Cheap
    undefined</p>

<p>All okay until that last one.  Again, I am willing to accept bad eyesight and poor spelling as the root. But I can't figure it out.</p>

<p>Our business is to take Orders through our new Order Capture GUI which must connect to our Customers Database, Product Catalogue, Ordering System and some other ancillary systems each of which will be exposed as WCF services, orders are then passed to our Order Management and other downstream systems for fulfilment and finally to our Billing system for invoicing. Currently each system has its own GUI and uses manual process to pass information between them, in an effort to automate and integrate the natural thought was to introduce an ESB to connect them.</p>

<p>Some of my rationale for an ESB is, the bus will worry about how to connect the systems (each system is agnostic and knows nothing of any other system) and how to format/translate the information. It is highly likely that in the future some of the existing systems will be swapped out for new systems or systems within our family of companies.</p>

<p>This seems to make sense to me but I am now being met with some resistance as to why introduce it when a Point-to-Point solution could suffice.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in the company history (prior to my appointment) an initial attempt to introduce BizTalk failed, but I am confident that it has a place and I can deliver it.</p>

<a href=""https://www.foobar.com/dashbaord"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.foobar.com/dashbaord</a></p>

<p>However, I want to move people off of SSL once logged in (to save CPU), so just after checking that they are in fact logged in on <a href=""https://www.foobar.com/dashbaord"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.foobar.com/dashbaord</a> I move them to 
<a href=""http://www.foobar.com/dashbaord"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.foobar.com/dashbaord</a></p>

<p>Well this always seems to wipe out the session variables, because when the page runs again, it confirms they are logged in (as all pages do) and session appears not to exist, so it moves them to the login screen.</p>

<p>Oddness/findings:</p>

<li>The second login always works, and happily gets me to <a href=""http://www.foobar.com/dashbaord"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.foobar.com/dashbaord</a></li>
<li>It successfully creates a cookie the first login</li>
<li>If I login twice, then logout, and login again, I don't need two logins (I seem to have traced this to the fact that the cookie exists). If I delete the cookie, I'm back to two logins.</li>
<li>After the second login, I can move from non-ssl from ssl and the session persists.</li>
<li>On the first login, the move to the non-ssl site wipes out the session entirely, manually moving back to the ssl site still forces me to login again.</li>
<li>The second login using the exact same mechanism as the first, over ssl</li>

<li>Playing with Cake's settings for security.level and session.checkagent - nothing</li>

It's past time to do something about that, and the upshot is that we'll be able to kill two Joel Test birds with one stone (daily builds and one-step builds, neither of which exists in any form whatsoever).</p>

<p>Relevant Tools:
Visual Build
Source Safe 6.0 (I know, but I can't do anything about whether or not we use Source Safe at this time.  That might be the next battle I fight.)</p>

<p>Tentatively, I've got a Visual Build project that does this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get source and place in local directory, including necessary DLLs needed for project.</li>
<li>Get config files and rename as needed (we're storing them in a special sub directory that isn't part of the actual application, and they are named according to use).</li>
<li>Build using Visual Studio</li>
<li>Precompile using command line, copying into what will be a ""build"" directory</li>
<li>Copy to destination.</li>
<li>Get any necessary additional resources - mostly things like documents, images, and reports that are associated with the project (and put into directory from step 5).  There's a lot of this stuff, and I didn't want to include it previously.  However, I'm going to only copy changed items, so maybe it's irrelevant.  I wasn't sure whether I really wanted to include this stuff in earlier steps.</li>
</ol>

<p>I still need to coax some logging out of Visual Build for all of this, but I'm not at a point where I need to do that yet.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any advice or suggestions to make?  We're not currently using a Deployment Project, I'll note.  It would remove some of the steps necessary in this build I presume (like web.config swapping).</p>

<p>I've want to get the picture (with or without caption) and then the title of the article. These 3 things I can get by using: </p>

<p>//div[@class='fondoprincipal'] &lt;-- gives me the main image and caption</p>

<p>//a[@class='cabezaprincesto']/text() &lt;-- gives me the article's title</p>

<p>but I can't get ahold of the small description which is the div with class=""resumenesto"", I haven't tried getting anything by that id because the same id is used over and over through the rest of the HTML so it returns lots of extra items.</p>

<p>How can I get this particular one? and then would any of you recommend me a good way of parsing it to another webpage? I was thinking maybe php writing some html using those values but I'm not sure really...</p>

The actual feature I would like to implement is to dump the entire output buffer to a text file at the end of program execution.</p>

<p>The workaround I use while I don't find a cleaner approach is to subclass <code>TextWriter</code> overriding the writing methods so they would both write to a file and call the original stdout writer. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class DirtyWorkaround {
  private class DirtyWriter : TextWriter {
    private TextWriter stdoutWriter;
    private StreamWriter fileWriter;

    public DirtyWriter(string path, TextWriter stdoutWriter) {
      this.stdoutWriter = stdoutWriter;
      this.fileWriter = new StreamWriter(path);
    }

    override public void Write(string s) {
      stdoutWriter.Write(s);

      fileWriter.Write(s);
      fileWriter.Flush();
    }

    // Same as above for WriteLine() and WriteLine(string),
    // plus whatever methods I need to override to inherit
    // from TextWriter (Encoding.Get I guess).
  }

  public static void Main(string[] args) {
    using (DirtyWriter dw = new DirtyWriter(""path"", Console.Out)) {
      Console.SetOut(dw);

      // Teh codez
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>See that it writes to and flushes the file all the time. I'd love to do it only at the end of the execution, but I couldn't find any way to access to the output buffer.</p>

<p>Also, excuse inaccuracies with the above code (had to write it <em>ad hoc</em>, sorry ;).</p>

<p>But now my company wants to resell it under different brands.  But since I <em>mostly</em> coded it well, I told my higher ups I could have a totally rebranded version done in under a week.  Basically all I would do is change a bunch of settings in an xml settings file, swap out the graphics with a new set, and build.</p>

<p>Problem is if they want 5 or 6 different brands, I'd have 5 different builds to support (I really should be supporting 1, with diff templates)</p>

<p>The problem is its not easy (as far as I know) to swap out the images in a winforms app.  I have all the graphical resources in a single folder, but once each file is entered into its respective image list or container in visual studio, the only way to get it to update is to remove it and re-add it, changing the source folder doesnt cause the embedded image to refresh.  This would be incredibly tedious for each build, there has got to be an easier way.</p>

So after some further investigation, I am leaning torwards some sort of resx file editor.  However the ones I have seen so far are more focused on translating strings to various languages, and are either very weak, or can not at all edit binary resources like bitmaps/png's.  Though if you open a resx file in an xml viewer (I use notepad 2 with .resx set to use xml sytax highlighting) MS is kind enough to tell you exactly how each type is compiled (mostly variations of base 64)</p>

<p>The code works as expected, it fires the map functions but no code is appended to the accordion content because the newContent object seems to be empty all the time.
I was debugging it with IE8 debugging tools and jqObj.length is zero so no change is made in the newcontent.

I have to copy the files on local staging servers, on different servers via FTP and sometimes I have to fetch them from customers' servers. </p>

<p>So, it would be nice to have all files for deployment in a compact form without the necessity of doing a lot of comparing between source and destination. Web deployment projects have this nice feature: compile all your aspx and ascx files into a single (additional) assembly. </p>

<p>I somehow found out <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/424230/is-there-a-way-to-get-rid-of-aspx-placeholder-files-in-a-asp-net-web-deployment-p"">how to get rid of aspx placeholder files</a> on the server, now I'd like to know if there is a (maybe self-made) way to <strong>get rid of these <code>.compiled</code> files</strong>. </p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.west-wind.com/presentations/AspNetCompilation/AspNetCompilation.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rick Strahl's blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The .Compiled file is a marker file
  for each page and control in the Web
  site and identifies the class used
  inside of the assembly. These files
  are not optional as they map the ASPX
  pages to the appropriate precompiled
  classes in the precompiled assemblies.
  If you remove the .Compiled file, the
  page that it maps will not be able to
  execute and you get a nasty execution
  error.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anybody out there with a creative idea, maybe using a module/handler which intercepts the check against the <code>.compiled</code> files in the bin folder?</p>

<p>Is there any other way to upload images in grails application.It has to accept only image files.</p>

<p>can anyone provide help?</p>

<p>thanks.</p>

<p>I'm currently reviewing the benefits of moving from SVN to a SourceGear Vault.
Has anyone got advice or a link to a detailed comparison between the two?
Bear in mind I would have to move my current Source Control system across which works strongly in SVN's favor</p>

<p>Here is some info I have found out thus far from my own investigations.</p>

<p>I have been taking some time tests between the two and vault seems to perform most operations much faster. Time tests used the same server as the repository, the same workstation client, and the same project.</p>

<p>I also found an online source comparing some other points. This is the kind of information i'm looking for.</p>

<p><strong>Usage Comparisons</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Subversion is edit/merge/commit only. Vault allows you to do either
edit/merge/commit or checkout/edit/checkin.</p></li>
<li><p>Vault looks and acts just like VSS, which makes the learning curve
effectively zero for VSS users.</p></li>
<li><p>Vault has a VS plugin, but it only works if you're going to run in
checkout-mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Subversion has clients for pretty much every OS you can imagine;
Vault has a GUI client for Windows and a command line client for Mono.</p></li>
<li><p>Both will support remote work, since both use HTTP as their
transport (Subversion uses extended DAV, Vault uses SOAP).</p></li>
<li><p>Subversion installation, especially w/ Apache, is more complex.</p></li>
<li><p>Subversion has a lot of third party support. Vault has just a few things.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Say I have the following in a valid XHTML file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;hello &lt;span&gt;world&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi there &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The End&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So I was thinking I could use XPath to get just the text nodes that I want, then trim the text, which would allow me to end up with what I want (previous).</p>

<p>I started with the following XPath:</p>

<pre><code>//root/p/child::text()
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the problem here is that it returns all text nodes that are children of all p-tags. Which is this:</p>

<pre><code>'hello '
' a '
'Hi there '
'The End '
</code></pre>

<p>Trying the following XPath gives me the last text node of the last paragraph, not the last text node of each paragraph that is a child of the root node.</p>

<pre><code>//root/p/child::text()[last()]
</code></pre>

<p>This only returns: <code>'The End '</code></p>

<p>What I would like to get from the XPath is therefore:</p>

<pre><code>' a '
'Hi there '
'The End '
</code></pre>

<p>Can I do this with XPath? Or should I maybe be looking at using regular expressions (That's probably more of a headache than XPath)?</p>

<p>For a variety of legacy reasons we are locked into using Java. We are in the process of deciding between using Qt Jambi and SWT for the GUI.

<p><b>Update 11 Feb:</b> Thanks for the great answers. For those that are curious, we will probably go with Jambi. It was mostly the style sheet functionality that won me over as they make easy a lot of the custom widget shape stuff we need to do. The Qt suite of examples showed that frameless, custom-shaped windows do indeed work on different platforms, so we shouldn't be caught short down the track. The LGPL release was why we were considering Jambi at all :)</p>

As this is my first script, I started with the loop; something familiar in any language. I ran it just printing the constructed URLs and it worked perfect. 
I then wrote the code to download the content and save it separately, and that worked perfect as well with a sample URL on multiple test cases.
But when I combined these two bits of code, it broke, the program just got stuck and did nothing at all.
I therefore ran the debugger and as I stepped through it, it became stuck on this one line:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If I just hit r to return from the subroutine it works and continues to another point on its way back down the call stack where something similar happens over and over for some time. The stack trace:</p>

"19968605","1","20097429","","2013-11-14 02:47:17","","1","6874","<p>I have a page that displays a picture in high quality.  The pictures typically take a while to load.  I have a jQuery function that runs on load of the picture <code>#image</code> I want this function to pre-load other images 1 at a time in the order they will appear.</p>

<p>So: on if I am on the 1st picture, it should load picture 1 and display it, then pre-load/cache the second picture when pic1 is done.  The pictures being loaded all have a caching header attached already.  When pic2 is done loading, pic3 should begin loading.  In case you are wondering, I have a cgi backend that is able to print things in loops and such.</p>

<p>So far I have the following working:</p>

<pre><code>$('#image').load(function() {
 preLoad2 = new Image()
 preLoad2.src = ""pic2""
})
</code></pre>

<p>I can then continue this with another function with the same <code>$('#image').load(function() { }</code> line, but how do I make it so the next picture doesn't begin loading until this one is completely loaded.  I would prefer not to use a timed delay as that is not very accurate. </p>

<p>Here is what I have currently.  I am using a bash cgi script in this example.</p>

<pre><code>#set a loop counter
# variables will be refered to as $[var-name]
count=1
first=true
#loop through all images that need pre-loading
for file in *
  do
    #check if the picture matches the search criteria
    if [[ ""$file"" = *$lowerSearch* ]]
      then
        #create a js script
        echo ""&lt;script language=\""javascript\"" type=\""text/javascript\""&gt;""
        echo ""function load$count() {""
        echo "" preLoad$count = new Image()""
        echo "" preLoad$count.src = \""?loadFile=$file\""""
        echo ""}""
        #the first one of these functions should be bound to the main image load event
        if [ ""$first"" = 'true' ]
          then
            echo ""document.getElementById('image').onload = load$count()""
        #the 2nd and on should be bound to the pre-load of the previous picture
        else
          echo "" preLoad$last.onload = load$count()""
        #end if
        fi
        echo ""&lt;/script&gt;""
        #store the current count so that the next time through it can be used to call the last loaded picture
        last=$count
        first=false
        #add 1 to count
        count=$((count+1))
    #end if
    fi
#end loop
done
</code></pre>

<p>How this works:  Loops through pictures.  If the picture matches the search criteria then run the main code...otherwise skip loop.  In the search criteria, it creates a js script that includes a function.  the function loads the picture that the loop is currently referring to.  It then creates an onLoad function that refers to the last picture pre-loaded and sets an onLoad event to it that runs the function just created.</p>

I need the value that is stored in the session to be saved until the post back on a particular page.  Let me illustrate:</p>

<pre><code>Page A:                             Page B:
Sets Session[""ID""] = 5       --&gt;    Gets Session[""ID""]
And redirects to Page B             and populates data.
</code></pre>

<p>I need the <code>Session[""ID""]</code> on Page B to stay alive until a post back is performed on Page B.  I need this because I will be using the value of <code>Session[""ID""]</code> update data in the database.  </p>

<p>My question is:  Is the any guarantee that the <code>Session[""ID""]</code> will maintain its value until a post back is performed?  Won't it die?  If so: What are some methods I can take to make sure it maintains its value?</p>

I build an executable for Windows using py2exe. The application as well as the binary are checked into Subversion. Distribution happens by people just checking out the directory from SVN. The program has about 6 different Python library dependencies (e.g. ElementTree, Mako)</p>

<p><strong>The situation</strong>: Developers want to hack on the source of this tool and then run it without having to build the binary. Currently this means that they need a python 2.6 interpreter (which is fine) and also have the 6 libraries installed locally using easy_install.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This is not a public, classical open source environment: I'm inside a corporate network, the tool will never leave the ""walled garden"" and we have seriously inconvenient barriers to getting to the outside internet (NTLM authenticating proxies and/or machines without direct internet access).</li>
<li>I want the hurdles to starting to hack on this tool to be minimal: nobody should have to hunt for the right dependency in the right version, they should have to execute as little setup as possible. Optimally the prerequisites would be having a Python installation and just checking out the program from Subversion.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Anecdote</strong>: The more self-contained the process is the easier it is to repeat it. I had my machine swapped out for a new one and went through the unpleasant process of having to reverse engineer the dependencies, reinstall distutils, hunting down the libraries online and getting them to install (see corporate internet restrictions above). </p>

<p>Our customer have a set of points and weight data along with each point as can be demonstrated by this image:</p>

<p><a href=""http://chakrit.net/files/stackoverflow/so_heightmap_points.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">weighted points http://chakrit.net/files/stackoverflow/so_heightmap_points.png</a></p>

<p>Of which, we have a GIS program that could generate a ""heightmap"" or a sort of terrain data from these points and their weight values but as we have near a thousand points of data and that these will change over time, we would like to create our own tools to auto-generate these heightmaps.</p>

<p>So far, I've tried to calculate the weight for each pixel from its distance to the closest data point with <code>Sqrt((x1 - x2) ^ 2 + (y1 - y2) ^ 2)</code> and applying weight and distance factor to the data point's color to produce the resulting gradient color for that particular pixel:</p>

<p><a href=""http://chakrit.net/files/stackoverflow/so_heightmap_result.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">heightmap result http://chakrit.net/files/stackoverflow/so_heightmap_result.png</a></p>

<p>You can see that there are still problems with certain configuration of data points and the algorithm sometimes produce a rather polygonal image when there is a lot of data points. The ideal result should looks more like an ellipsis and less like a polygon.</p>

<p>Here is one example image from wikipedia article on gradient ascent which demonstrates the result I want:</p>

<p><a href=""http://chakrit.net/files/stackoverflow/so_gradient_descent.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mountains http://chakrit.net/files/stackoverflow/so_gradient_descent.png</a></p>

<p>The gradient ascent algorithm is not of my interest. What I'm interested in; is the algorithm to calculate the original function in that picture in the first place, provided data points with weights.</p>

<p>I've not taken any class in topological maths, but I can do some calculus. I think I may be missing something and am rather lost at what should I type in that Google search box.</p>

<p>I need some pointers.</p>

<p>I discovered that I can get NHibernate to load the mapping successfully even with the non-virtual methods present if I set the ""lazy"" attribute on the class element of the mapping file to ""false"".  I'm wondering what impact this will have on my use of NHibernate with this class.  </p>

<p>I understand the meaning of non-lazy loading on collections that belong to an object, but I'm not clear on the meaning of what lazy or eager loading on a class would be.  Does that mean all collections belonging to that object would be eager-loaded? Or does it mean that NHibernate no longer uses a dynamic proxy in place of the actual class?  Something else?</p>

<p>Also, what's the best course of action here?  Is setting that lazy=false value inadvisable?  Should I create an interface that the class implements, and then map that to the table?  Or should I just bite the bullet and mark all the existing methods on the class virtual?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any and all advice!</p>

<p>Some of the metadata would almost certainly be unique (titles/descriptions/etc), whilst some would be repetitive to varying degrees (categories/tags/etc).<br>
It may also be useful to group the metadata, if different types of attribute are required.</p>

The tricky part is that under certain conditions, I want to ""un-iterate.""  That is, put an item back onto the front of the iterator before I loop.</p>

<p>For example, suppose I'm picking apples from a tree.  My fruit basket can only hold 10kg before it needs to be emptied.  But I have to pick each apple before I can weigh it and determine if this apple would exceed the capacity of the basket.</p>

<p>In a language like Perl, I could <code>unshift()</code> the apple back onto the tree, and then let the loop expression re-pick the apple:</p>

<pre><code>while ($apple = shift(@tree)) {
  $wt = weight($apple);
  if ($wt + weight(@basket) &gt; 10) {
    send(@basket);
    @basket = ();
    unshift(@tree, $apple);
  } else {
    push(@basket, $element);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or else I can also use <code>redo</code>, which resumes processing at the top of block, without evaluating the loop expression.  So the same apple can be re-processed, after the basket has been emptied.</p>

<pre><code>while ($apple = shift(@tree)) {
  $wt = weight($apple);
  if ($wt + weight(@basket) &gt; 10) {
    send(@basket);
    @basket = ();
    redo;
  } else {
    push(@basket, $apple);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>What would be the most <strong>pythonic</strong> solution for this kind of problem?</p>

<p>Dropping the float on the date element fixes this problem, as does setting <code>zoom: 1</code> on the paragraph or removing <code>overflow: hidden</code> on the container, but all are not ideal. Why does a float followed by a paragraph trigger this additional top margin, only on IE7?</p>

<p>When I make the same AJAX call using JSONP to a server in the same domain as the web page, all goes well in all browsers (including IE6).  However, when I make calls between domains (XSS) using JSONP, Internet Explorer 6 locks up.  Specifically, the CPU spikes to 100% and the 'success' callback is never reached.  The only time I have had success going between domains is when the response is very short (less than 150 bytes typically).  The length of the response seems important.</p>

<p>I'm using jQuery 1.2.6.  I've tried the $.getJSON() method and the $.ajax(dataType: ""jsonp"") method without success.  This works beautifully in FF3 and IE7.  I haven't been able to find anyone else with a similar problem.  I thought this type of functionality was fully supported by jQuery in IE6.</p>

<p>Any help is very appreciated,</p>

<p><strong>Here is the code for the html page making the AJAX call</strong>.  Make a local copy of this file (and jquery library) and give it a shot using IE6.  For me, it always causes the CPU to spike with no response rendered.</p>

<p>Here is the JSON that comes back in the response.  According to JSLint, it is valid JSON (once you remove the method call surrounding it).   The real results would be different, but this seemed like that simplest example that would cause this to fail.  The server is a ASP.Net application returning a response of type 'application/json.'  I've tried changing the response type to 'application/javascript' and 'application/x-javascript' but it didn't have any affect.  I really appreciate the help.</p>

Obviously, this can be done in O(N choose L) using a combination generating algorithm.  What I'm really interested in is clever hacks to significantly speed it up past that.</p>

<p>The solution proposed in an answer to that question was to hook up a custom proxy server that checks the responses and filters out anything that would lead to a download prompt. How can I implement such a proxy in my .NET application? I don't want to install third-party software or libraries.</p>

<p>I found the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httplistener.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HttpListener class</a>, but I've got two problems with it:</p>

<ol>
<li>The listener requires a predefined set of prefixes that trigger it. I would, however, prefer not to hard-code host names or port numbers in my application, and keep it generic.</li>
<li>I would have to implement the code that does the actual request myself - isn't there something that does this for me where I can simply tap into the line, examining the contents of the response and changing them as neccessary (like a request filter in J2EE does on the server side)?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Okay, I guess I need to make this clearer: My .NET (rich client) application is being used in multiple projects which also have web-based applications. The .NET application includes a reusable, generic form with a WebBrowser control. Other developers use that form to integrate access to their web applications into the .NET application.</p>

<p>I want to block downloads, so I want to have my WebBrowser form intercept all traffic and ensure that it does not lead to a ""Save as"" dialog. Thus...</p>

<ul>
<li>I do not know what the host names will be</li>
<li>The WebBrowser points to the real URLs, the user clicks regular links, triggers JavaScript... all as served by the web application</li>
<li>If the WebBrowser pointed to localhost (as proposed), I'd have to parse responses and rewrite all links so they point at localhost again, preserving the original URL. I don't want to go through that hassle.</li>

<p>I also tried to enable the ""Use Apache mod_rewrite"".

When clicking on menu links, this seems to work in that I no longer see index.php in the URL. The address bar updates to what appears like the right URL, but the content shown is always that of the home page. I tried both in IE and Google Chrome with the same result. Refreshing the page after loaded made no difference.</p>

<p>I tried re-starting IIS7, it didn't make a difference.</p>

The URL still appears to be correctly rewritten. So, different behavior but still doesn't work. I'm not sure this is useful information, but these two fields are shown in the 404 page:
Requested URL   <a href=""http://localhost:80/joomla_course/seasonal-specialties"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://localhost:80/joomla_course/seasonal-specialties</a>
Physical Path   C:\inetpub\wwwroot\joomla_course\seasonal-specialties
Should the physical path be the 'non-rewritten' URL? Or is it expected that that it be like this?</p>

<pre><code>public Project Project { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>This is normally not a problem as long as we stay within the C# codebase. However, these business object classes are exposed in web services over the wire. Some consuming languages (such as Flex's actionscript) cannot handle having a property with the same name as its class.</p>

<p>This naming conflict happens all over the place in our code. Sometimes it's easy to change the name of the property or class. Sometimes it's really hard. We've wracked our brains and can't come up with a good standard way to handle this. It's possible to rename the Project class to ProjectType or ProjectInfo, but this is ugly and breaks all of our consumers' existing code. We could leave the type name the same and change the name of the property to ProjectInfo, but this causes the same problem.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any guidance or best practices for such a situation?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Responding to some of the suggestions given:</p>

<ul>
<li>Methods aren't exposed over the wire, so we can't use methods.</li>
<li>I'd prefer a standard naming convention that also adheres to Microsoft's own naming standards.</li>
<li>Exposing a different contract for Flex may be an option. However, we're using Weborb for Flex interop. Weborb uses reflection to match the property names exactly, rather than using XML or SOAP serialization. If anyone knows more about custom serialization with Weborb, that would be helpful.</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT #2:</p>

<p>For reference, we ended up renaming the property to something like:</p>

<p>EDIT: Having looked into the boost::signal approach, it seems it's probably implemented using a token system as some of you have suggested. <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/doc/html/signals/tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here's some info on this</a>. An observer retains a ""Connection"" object when they attach to an event, and this connection object is used to disconnect if needed. So it looks like whether you use Boost or roll your own with tr1, the basic principle's the same. i.e. it will be a bit clumsy :) </p>

|  |  | a lot of stuff.   |   |

<p>My solution has been to hard code in a reference to the parent (or however far up the display list we need to go to find an explicitly set value as opposed to a percentage).</p>

<p>I've even considered using this in a utility class:</p>

<p>It can either call the webservice using POST or using GET.</p>

<p>The code for using POST is</p>

<pre><code>public void PerformRequest()
{
  WebRequest webRequest = WebRequest.Create(_uri);

  webRequest.ContentType = ""application/ocsp-request"";
  webRequest.Method = ""POST"";
  webRequest.Credentials = _credentials;
  webRequest.ContentLength = _request.Length;
  ((HttpWebRequest)webRequest).KeepAlive = false;

  using (Stream st = webRequest.GetRequestStream())
    st.Write(_request, 0, _request.Length);

  using (HttpWebResponse httpWebResponse = (HttpWebResponse)webRequest.GetResponse())
  using (Stream responseStream = httpWebResponse.GetResponseStream())
  using (BufferedStream bufferedStream = new BufferedStream(responseStream))
  using (BinaryReader reader = new BinaryReader(bufferedStream))
  {
    if (httpWebResponse.StatusCode != HttpStatusCode.OK)
      throw new WebException(""Got response status code: "" + httpWebResponse.StatusCode);

    byte[] response = reader.ReadBytes((int)httpWebResponse.ContentLength);
    httpWebResponse.Close();
  }      
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code for using GET is:</p>

<pre><code>protected override void PerformRequest()
{
  WebRequest webRequest = WebRequest.Create(_uri + ""/"" + Convert.ToBase64String(_request));

  webRequest.Method = ""GET"";
  webRequest.Credentials = _credentials;
  ((HttpWebRequest)webRequest).KeepAlive = false;

  using (HttpWebResponse httpWebResponse = (HttpWebResponse)webRequest.GetResponse())
  using (Stream responseStream = httpWebResponse.GetResponseStream())
  using (BufferedStream bufferedStream = new BufferedStream(responseStream))
  using (BinaryReader reader = new BinaryReader(bufferedStream))
  {
    if (httpWebResponse.StatusCode != HttpStatusCode.OK)
      throw new WebException(""Got response status code: "" + httpWebResponse.StatusCode);

    byte[] response = reader.ReadBytes((int)httpWebResponse.ContentLength);
    httpWebResponse.Close();
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the code is quite similar. If anything, I would expect the GET-method to be slightly slower, as it has to encode and transmit the data in Base64.</p>

<p>But when I run it, I see that the POST-method uses far more processing power than the GET-method. On my machine, I can run 80 threads of the GET-method using approximately 5% CPU, while 80 threads of the POST-method uses 95% CPU.</p>

<p>Is there something inherently more expensive about using POST? Is there anything I can do to optimize the POST-method? I cannot reuse the connection, as I want to simulate requests from different clients.</p>

<p>dotTrace reports that 65% of the processing-time is spent in webRequest.GetResponse() when using POST.</p>

<p>The underlying webservice uses Digest-Authentication if that makes any difference.</p>

<p>In the following (simple) example, the text function is only evaluated when a writer is present:</p>

<pre><code>public static void PrintLine(Func&lt;string&gt; text, TextWriter writer)
{
    if (writer != null)
    {
        writer.WriteLine(text());

<p>Unfortunately, this makes using the code a little bit ugly. You cannot call it with a constant or variable like</p>

<pre><code>PrintLine(""Some text"", Console.Out);
</code></pre>

<p>and have to call it this way:</p>

<pre><code>PrintLine(() =&gt; ""Some text"", Console.Out);
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler is not able to ""infer"" a parameterless function from the passed constant. Are there any plans to improve this in future versions of C# or am I missing something?</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I just found a dirty hack myself:</p>

<pre><code>    public class F&lt;T&gt;
    {
       private readonly T value;
       private readonly Func&lt;T&gt; func;

       public F(T value) { this.value = value; }
       public F(Func&lt;T&gt; func) {this.func = func; }

       public static implicit operator F&lt;T&gt;(T value)
       {
            return new F&lt;T&gt;(value);
       }

       public static implicit operator F&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;T&gt; func)
       {
           return new F&lt;T&gt;(func);
       }

       public T Eval()
       {
           return this.func != null ? this.func() : this.value;
       }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now i can just define the function as:</p>

<pre><code>public static void PrintLine(F&lt;string&gt; text, TextWriter writer)
{
    if (writer != null)
    {
        writer.WriteLine(text.Eval());
    }
}

<p>and call it both with a function or a value.</p>

<h2>Use case:</h2>

<p>There is a file on a server that I want to edit called ""importantFile.txt"". The file has owner and group of ""master"":</p>

<pre><code>ls -l importantFile.txt:
-rw-rw-r--  1 master master     7 Mar 18 08:11 importantFile.txt

<p>I am called ""slave"" but luckily, I am in group ""master"" so I can edit the file as I see fit. However, I'm a lazy slave and can't be bothered to edit the file on the server, I'd prefer to edit the file on my local machine and SCP it to the server:</p>

<pre><code>echo ""bored slave info"" &gt; importantFile.txt
scp importantFile.txt slave@theServerAddress:/pathToFile/importantFile.txt
</code></pre>

<p>If I do this, the contents of the file on the server are uploaded fine and the timestamp of the file is updated but the permissions of the file don't change, the file is still owned by ""master"". This is a problem because if ""slave"" uploaded bad content, no one would know it was ""slave"" who caused the problem, ""master"" would look guilty.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>I'd like to make concurrent/parallel/simultaneous HTTP requests in PHP. I'd like to avoid consecutive requests as:</p>

<ul>
<li>a set of requests will take too long to complete; the more requests the longer</li>
<li>the timeout of one request midway through a set may cause later requests to not be made (if a script has an execution time limit)</li>
</ul>

<p>I have managed to find details for making <a href=""http://www.phpied.com/simultaneuos-http-requests-in-php-with-curl/"" rel=""noreferrer"">simultaneuos [sic] HTTP requests in PHP with cURL</a>, however I'd like to explicitly use PHP's <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/book.http.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">HTTP functions</a> if at all possible.</p>

<p>Specifically, I need to POST data concurrently to a set of URLs. The URLs to which data are posted are beyond my control; they are user-set.</p>

<p>I don't mind if I need to wait for all requests to finish before the responses can be processed. If I set a timeout of 30 seconds on each request and requests are made concurrently, I know I must wait a maximum of 30 seconds (perhaps a little more) for all requests to complete.</p>

<p>I can find no details of how this might be achieved. However, I did recently notice a mention in the PHP manual of PHP5+ being able to handle concurrent HTTP requests - I intended to make a note of it at the time, forgot, and cannot find it again.</p>

<p><strong>Single request example (works fine)</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$request_1 = new HttpRequest($url_1, HTTP_METH_POST);
$request_1-&gt;setRawPostData($dataSet_1);
$request_1-&gt;send();
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Concurrent request example (incomplete, clearly)</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$request_1 = new HttpRequest($url_1, HTTP_METH_POST);
$request_1-&gt;setRawPostData($dataSet_1);

$request_2 = new HttpRequest($url_2, HTTP_METH_POST);
$request_2-&gt;setRawPostData($dataSet_2);

// ...

$request_N = new HttpRequest($url_N, HTTP_METH_POST);
$request_N-&gt;setRawPostData($dataSet_N);

// Do something to send() all requests at the same time
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Any thoughts would be most appreciated!</p>

<p><strong>Clarification 1</strong>: I'd like to stick to the PECL HTTP functions as:</p>

<ul>
<li>they offer a nice OOP interface</li>
<li>they're used extensively in the application in question and sticking to what's already in use should be beneficial from a maintenance perspective</li>
<li>I generally have to write fewer lines of code to make an HTTP request using the PECL HTTP functions compared to using cURL - fewer lines of code should also be beneficial from a maintenance perspective</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Clarification 2</strong>: I realise PHP's HTTP functions aren't built in and perhaps I worded things wrongly there, which I shall correct. I have no concerns about people having to install extra stuff - this is not an application that is to be distributed, it's a web app with a server to itself.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification 3</strong>: I'd be perfectly happy if someone authoritatively states that the PECL HTTP cannot do this.</p>

<p>I'm developing an application that is going to be distributed shrinkwrapped. We have gotten the rights to distribute SQL Server 2008 Express Edition with our application, but exactly HOW to do this is a little more difficult. Right now we're using a standard Visual Studio setup project, and I was obviously hoping for something very easy, like a configurable merge module, but obviously no such thing exists or I wouldn't be posting here ;)</p>

<p>The road I had started going down was to include the self-extracting EXE with our package, then use a custom install action to extract it and pass command line arguments to the SQL installer to create our named instance. Here's where the problem comes in.</p>

<p>Extraction is fine. I can run the script from Windows and it installs SQL Server just as it should, but I can't run the SQL installer from my custom action because it's saying that there is already another installation in progress. This other installation is, of course, my application, and it isn't going to end until SQL Server finishes, so we're essentially at a deadlock until SQL finally gives up and errors out.</p>

<p>What I WANT is a named instance of SQL server for my application that is installed with it and gets uninstalled with it. Writing my own installer is not an option because of time, and my coworker says InstallShield is not an option because of complexity (I've never used it, so I'll take his word for it). Does anyone have any thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>The question I have is how to make the decision between using foreign keys to lookup tables, or using lookup table values directly in the tables requesting it, avoiding the lookup table relationship completely.</strong></p>

<p>Points to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>With the second method you would
need to do mass updates to all
records referencing the data if it
is changed in the lookup table.</p></li>
<li><p>This is focused more
towards tables that have a lot of
the column's referencing many lookup
tables.Therefore lots of foreign
keys means a lot of
joins every time you query the
table.</p></li>
<li>This data would be coming from drop
down lists which would be pulled
from the lookup tables. In order to match up data when reloading, the values need to be in the existing list (<em>related to the first point</em>).</li>

One of my biggest challenges is implementing security for the application in a flexible and maintainable way. This challenge is compounded when different technologies are involved.  I'll try to describe what I have below.</p>

<p>The website is laid out as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>/mydomain.com/

<ul>
<li>Login.aspx</li>
<li>Default.aspx  <em>(hosts flex [.swf] application)</em></li>
<li>/Administration/

<ul>
<li>AddUsers.aspx</li>
<li>AddRoles.aspx</li>
<li>AddPermissions.aspx</li>
<li>etc...</li>
</ul></li>
<li>/Services/    

<ul>
<li>SecurityService.asmx</li>
<li>MapService.asmx</li>
<li>PhotoService.asmx</li>
<li>etc...</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I am currently using forms authentication to secure the resources on the website. All pages/resources not in the /Services/ folder require an authenticated user and will be redirected to Login.aspx if they are not yet authenticated. The .asmx pages allow unauthenticated users. To secure these resources I throw an exception in the SOAP method. This avoids redirecting pages for SOAP web services which is not supported by any SOAP web service clients I am aware of.  Finally, SecurityService.asmx contains a Login method to allow the Flex application to Login without redirecting to the Login.aspx page should the cookie expire for any reason.  Because the cookie established is sent with any request to the server, including requests coming from the Flex application, this seems to work pretty well.  </p>

<p>However, this still feels like a bad approach securing web services. I feel like I am using Forms Authentication for something it was not intended for. Specifically, I am concerned about:</p>

<ul>
<li>This model will not work when the services are separated from the core website. This is a newly discovered requirement and I believe that Forms Authentication is not going to work well (if at all) without a lot more modification and trickery.</li>
<li>Clients other the Flex may require access to the services. Some of these clients may not even be able use cookies.  If so, this model immediately falls apart.  This is not an immediate requirement but it is known that this is one of the long term goals. </li>
<li>We will eventually (hopefully sooner rather than later) move to a REST based architecture (vs. SOAP) so any solution needs to work for SOAP and REST.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, my question is. </p>

<p><strong>What are the best authentication and authorization mechanisms for securing an application built on ASP.NET, Flex, and SOAP or REST web services?</strong></p>

<p><em>Note: I am actively looking into OAuth; however, I am having a difficult time finding complete examples from which to learn.  Additionally, I need to be able to filter the data returned for a given user based on the permissions that user has, OAuth seems to remove the identity of the user from the token.  As such, I am not sure how OAuth applies in a fine grained security model.</em></p>

<p>What is the proper way to translate this for displaying in an URL using PHP on linux.</p>

<p>So far I've seen several solutions:</p>

this has strange results:<br>
<code>'Aït Ben Haddou' → /gallery/280-At_Ben_Haddou/</code><br>
Not really helpfull.</p></li>
<li><p>just strip all non allowed characters, replace spaces, leave charcode (stackoverflow.com) most likely because of the 'regex-hammer' used<br>
this gives strange results: 
<code>'tést tést' → /questions/0000/t233st-t233st</code></p></li>
<li><p>translate to 'nearest equivalent'<br>
<code>'Aït Ben Haddou' → /gallery/280-Ait_Ben_Haddou/</code><br>
But this goes wrong for german; for example 'ü' should be transliterated 'ue'.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For me, as a Dutch person, the 3rd result 'looks' the best.<br>
I'm quite sure however that (1) many people will have a different opinion and (2) it is just plain wrong in the german example.</p>

<p>Another problem with the 3rd option is: how to find all possible characters that can be converted to a 7bit equivalent?</p>

<p>So the question is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>what, in your opinion, is the most desirable result. (within tech-limits)</p></li>
<li><p>How to technically solve it. (reach the desired result) with PHP.</p></li>

<ol>
<li>is it OK to have a PHP file that starts out with HTML tags and only has PHP inserted where needed? Or should you just have one section of php that contains everything?</li>
<li>If you have a chunk of PHP code in the middle of which is a set of echo's that just output a fixed bit of HTML, is it better to break out of php and just put the HTML directly? </li>
<li>Should functions all be defined in dedicated php files, or is it ok to define a bunch of functions at the top of a file and call them later on in that same file?</li>
</ol>

<p>There's probably other questions I'd like to ask, but really I'm looking for someone to point me at some kind of resource online that offers guidance on the general idea of how HTML and PHP should be combined together.</p>

"706167","1","1437189","","2009-04-01 15:52:10","","18","6972","<p>A problem I was working on recently got me to wishing that I could lop off the front of a file. Kind of like a “truncate at front,” if you will. Truncating a file at the back end is a common operation–something we do without even thinking much about it. But lopping off the front of a file? Sounds ridiculous at first, but only because we’ve been trained to think that it’s impossible. But a lop operation could be useful in some situations.</p>

<p>A simple example (certainly not the only or necessarily the best example) is a FIFO queue. You’re adding new items to the end of the file and pulling items out of the file from the front. The file grows over time and there’s a huge empty space at the front. With current file systems, there are several ways around this problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>As each item is removed, copy the
remaining items up to replace it, and
truncate the file. Although it works,
this solution is very expensive
time-wise.</li>
<li>Monitor the size of the empty space at
the front, and when it reaches a
particular size or percentage of the
entire file size, move everything up
and truncate the file. This is much
more efficient than the previous
solution, but still costs time when
items are moved in the file.</li>
<li>Implement a circular queue in the
file, adding new items to the hole at
the front of the file as items are
removed. This can be quite efficient,
especially if you don’t mind the
possibility of things getting out of
order in the queue. If you do care
about order, there’s the potential of
having to move items around. But in
general, a circular queue is pretty
easy to implement and manages disk
space well.</li>
</ul>

<p>But if there was a lop operation, removing an item from the queue would be as easy as updating the beginning-of-file marker. As easy, in fact, as truncating a file. Why, then, is there no such operation?</p>

<p>I understand a bit about file systems implementation, and don't see any particular reason this would be difficult.  It looks to me like all it would require is another word (dword, perhaps?) per allocation entry to say where the file starts within the block.  With 1 terabyte drives under $100 US, it seems like a pretty small price to pay for such functionality.</p>

<p>What other tasks would be made easier if you could lop off the front of a file as efficiently as you can truncate at the end?</p>

<p>Can you think of any technical reason this function couldn't be added to a modern file system?  Other, non-technical reasons?</p>

<p>The background is that we are discussing a migration from PVCS Dimensions to Subversion, and the main feature cited as missing in Subversion is ""Design Parts"". A design part is an arbitrary collection of files that can be handled together, e.g. all the source files needed for a subproject.</p>

<p>One idea to replace this is by copy operations in a Makefile, which copy the relevant files into a branch. But if all files are copied separately this may lead to a lot of revisions, which may clutter the history, so it would be nice to avoid that.</p>

<p><b>EDIT:</b>
Some more background information:</p>

<p>The project consists of several (5-10) subprojects which are released separately, but which share some common source files and external libraries imported from other projects. </p>

<p>One reason cited for the design parts is restricting dependencies on source files,
another is for managing the products of subprojects, so that all of them can be updated in version control in one operation. Both kinds of files are somewhat sprinkled across directories.</p>

<p>The purpose is to prevent spam.  HTML is stripped so I need to detect invitations to copy-and-paste.  <em>It should not be economical for a spammer to post links because most users could not successfully get to the page</em>.  I would like suggestions, references, or discussion on best-practices.</p>

<p>Some objectives:</p>

<ul>
<li>The low-hanging fruit like well-formed URLs (<code>http://some-fqdn/some/valid/path.ext</code>)</li>
<li>URLs but without the <code>http://</code> prefix (i.e. a valid FQDN + valid HTTP path)</li>
<li>Any other funny business</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, I am blocking spam, but the same process could be used to auto-link text.</p>

<h2>Ideas</h2>

<p>Here are some things I'm thinking.</p>

<ul>
<li>The content is native-language prose so I can be trigger-happy in detection</li>
<li>Should I strip out all whitespace first, to catch ""<code>www .example.com</code>""? Would common users know to remove the space themselves, or do any browsers ""do-what-I-mean"" and strip it for you?</li>
<li>Maybe multiple passes is a better strategy, with scans for:

<ul>
<li>Well-formed URLs</li>
<li>All non-whitespace followed by '.' followed by any valid TLD</li>
<li>Anything else?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Update and Summary</h2>

<p>Wow, I there are some very good heuristics listed in here! For me, the best bang-for-the-buck is a synthesis of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>@Jon Bright's technique of detecting TLDs (a good defensive chokepoint)</li>
<li>For those suspicious strings, replace the dot with a dot-looking character as per @capar</li>
<li>A good dot-looking character is @Sharkey's subscripted &amp;middot; (i.e. ""<sub>&middot;</sub>"").  &amp;middot; is also a word boundary so it's harder to casually copy &amp; paste.</li>
</ol>

<p>That should make a spammer's CPM low enough for my needs; the ""flag as inappropriate"" user feedback should catch anything else. Other solutions listed are also very useful:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strip out all dotted-quads (@Sharkey's comment to his own answer)</li>
<li>@Sporkmonger's requirement for client-side Javascript which inserts a required hidden field into the form.</li>
<li>Pinging the URL server-side to establish whether it is a web site.  (Perhaps I could run the HTML through SpamAssassin or another Bayesian filter as per @Nathan..)</li>
<li>Looking at Chrome's source for its smart address bar to see what clever tricks Google uses</li>

<p>Using Process Monitor led me directly to the problem. Many thanks to Mun for the tip.</p>

<p>It was quite an obscure issue: I had previously used the assembly binding log viewer (fuslogvw.exe) and set it to log all binds to disk using the custom path option. However, the ASPNET account did not have permissions to that custom path. So, reverting to using the default path resolved the issue. Granting read/write permissions on that custom path to the ASPNET account also works, as does disabling bind logging.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot, your answers helped to identify the problem. 
it turns out that there was a bug in the validate plugin for JQuery. We used a patch to avoid the validation of hidden input fields, which uses <strong>parents().filter("":hidden"")</strong>.

<p>The problem is that (as far as I can tell) the nested ListView approach requires me to shape the data before using it, and I can't figure out the best approach to take. The best I've been able to come up with so far is to put a LINQ query in my data access layer like so:</p>

<pre><code>var result = from widget in GetAllWidgets(int widgetTypeID)
             group widget by widget.Manufacturer into groupedWidgets
             let widgets = from widgetGroup in groupedWidgets
                           select widgetGroup
             select new { Manufacturer = groupedWidgets.Key, Widgets = widgets };
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, anonymous types can't be passed around, so that doesn't work. Defining a custom class to enclose data seems like the wrong way to go. Is there some way I can perform the grouping on the ASP.NET side of things? I'm using ObjectDataSources to access the DAL.</p>

<p><b>Updated</b>: OK, I'm not creating an anonymous type anymore, and instead my DAL passes an <code>IEnumerable&lt;IGrouping&lt;Manufacturer, Widget&gt;&gt;</code> to the ASP.NET page, but how can I use this in my ListViews? I need to render the following HTML (or something pretty much like it)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foo Corp.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Baz&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Quux&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bar Corp.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Thinger&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Whatsit&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Originally, I had a ListView within a ListView like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:ListView ID=""ManufacturerListView""&gt;
    &lt;LayoutTemplate&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;asp:Placeholder ID=""itemPlaceholder"" runat=""server"" /&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/LayoutTemplate&gt;
    &lt;ItemTemplate&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;asp:Label Text='&lt;%# Eval(""Manufacturer.Name"") %&gt;' /&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;asp:ListView ID=""WidgetsListView"" runat=""server"" DataSource='&lt;%# Eval(""Widgets"") %&gt;'&gt;
            &lt;LayoutTemplate&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                    &lt;asp:PlaceHolder runat=""server"" ID=""itemPlaceholder"" /&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
           &lt;/LayoutTemplate&gt;
           &lt;ItemTemplate&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;&lt;asp:Label Text='&lt;%# Eval(""Name"") %&gt;'&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;/ItemTemplate&gt;
        &lt;/asp:ListView&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ItemTemplate&gt;
&lt;/asp:ListView&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note how the <code>DataSource</code> property of WidgetsListView is itself databound. How can I duplicate this functionality without reshaping the data?</p>

<p>This is getting kind of complicated, sorry if I should have just made a separate question instead.</p>

<p>I have an application I have been developing for years, which has, until now taken about 30-40 MB in my particular test configuration; now with Java 6u10 and 11 it is taking several hundred while active.  It bounces around a lot, anywhere between 50M and 200M, and when it idles, it <em>does</em> GC and drop the memory right down.  In addition it generates millions of page faults.  All of this is observed via Windows Task Manager.</p>

<p>So, I ran it up under my profiler (jProfiler) and using jVisualVM, and both of them indicate the usual moderate heap and perm-gen usages of around 30M combined, even when fully active doing my load-test cycle.</p>

<p>So I am mystified! And it not just requesting more memory from the Windows Virtual Memory pool - this is showing up as 200M ""Mem Usage"".</p>

<p>CLARIFICATION: I want to be perfectly clear on this - observed over an 18 hour period with Java VisualVM the class heap and perm gen heap have been perfectly stable.  The allocated volatile heap (eden and tenured) sits unmoved at 16MB (which it reaches in the first few minutes), and the use of this memory fluctuates in a perfect pattern of growing evenly from 8MB to 16MB, at which point GC kicks in an drops it back to 8MB.  Over this 18 hour period, the system was under constant maximum load since I was running a stress test.  This behavior is <em>perfectly</em> and <em>consistently</em> reproducible, seen over numerous runs.  The only anomaly is that while this is going on the memory taken from Windows, observed via Task Manager, fluctuates all over the place from 64MB up to 900+MB.</p>

<p>UPDATE 2008-12-18: I have run the program with -Xms16M -Xmx16M without any apparent adverse affect - performance is fine, total run time is about the same.  But memory use in a short run still peaked at about 180M.</p>

<p>Update 2009-01-21: It seems the answer may be in the number of threads - see my answer below.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: And I mean millions of page faults literally - in the region of 30M+.</p>

<p>EDIT: I have a 4G machine, so the 200M is not significant in that regard.</p>

<p>I have two goals:<br/>
1. Obfuscate all the managed code so it can't be disassembled<br/>
2. Obfuscate the public methods/classes of the mixed DLL so no one can use the DLL in their own applications, i.e., scramble the public names.</p>

<p>Yes, I understand obfuscation isn't perfect and people can still figure it out and blah blah.  The two goals are a management requirement.  The only app I've found that can handle this appears to be the Dotfuscator Professional Edition.  Unfortunately it is one of those incredibly annoying apps where you have to beg a salesman to tell you the price.  Does anyone know of a another solution, or know of a good place to buy a cheap, legal copy? </p>

<p>Don't tell me to rewrite the DLL in managed code, that would take a month of work and I'd never get approval. :-)</p>

<p>Note that I'm not particularly paranoid about how <em>good</em> the obfuscation is.  Anything that scrambles the names of all the methods and classes in the app is probably good enough.</p>

<p>Here are the other obfuscators I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dotfuscator Community Edition comes with Visual Studio 2008 but doesn't support mixed assemblies.</p></li>
<li><p>Eazfuscator .NET is simple and free but doesn't support mixed assemblies.</p></li>
<li><p>{smartassembly} is $500 for a single license.  It has some interesting features, but it doesn't support mixed assemblies.</p></li>
<li><p>Salamander is $800.  Claims to fully support mixed assemblies, but whenever I tried to use the obfuscated dll, the application crashed</p></li>
<li><p>.NET Reactor is $180 for a single developer license.  It supports ""partial"" obfuscation of mixed DLLs. Unfortunately if you obfuscate the <em>public</em> types on the DLL it doesn't work, the .exe can't find the classes.  It has the ability to merge/pack DLLs into an .exe but when you do it with a mixed DLL it doesn't work (the exe can't find the DLL's assembly, even though it's part of the .exe)</p></li>
<li><p>Skater is $300 for a single license.  I don't see anything on their website claiming it supports mixed assemblies and I'm tired of trying apps only to be disappointed so I'm going to assume it doesn't.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have also tried Microsoft's ILMerge to see if I could merge the DLL with the .exe and then obfuscate, but it appears that also chokes on mixed DLLs.</p>

<p>Any suggestions for an alternative to Dotfuscator or a good place to buy a legitimate copy?  I found a couple of no-name sites claiming to sell it cheap but I assume those are Russian pirated versions.</p>

<p>I've worked out the problem is that the call to SqlDataReader.HasRows is returning false even though the dataset is not empty and removing the check allows the loop through reader.Read() to access the expected data. </p>

<pre><code>    _connectionString = WebConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[""SQLServer""].ConnectionString;
    SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString);
    SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(searchtype, connection);
    SqlParameter _parSeachTerm = new SqlParameter(""@searchterm"", SqlDbType.VarChar, 255);
    _parSeachTerm.Value = searchterm;
    command.Parameters.Add(_parSeachTerm);
    command.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;
    try
    {
        connection.Open();
        SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();
        if (reader.HasRows) //this always returns false!?
        {
            while (reader.Read())
            {...
</code></pre>

<p>Does anybody have any idea what's going on? There are similar code blocks on other pages where HasRows returns the correct value.</p>

<p>EDIT- Just to clarify, the stored procedure DOES return results which I have confirmed because the loop runs through fine if I remove the HasRows check. Changing just the name of the SQL server in the connection string to an identical database running on SQL 2000 makes the problem go away. I've checked that NOCOUNT is off, so what else could make HasRows return false when that's not the case??</p>

<p>EDIT2- Here's the SP</p>

<pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE StaffEnquirySurnameSearch

<p>I need to convert our current development environment from Windows&nbsp;XP 32-bit to Windows&nbsp;Vista 64-bit (*). Naturally, I've run into plenty of places in our build system where hardcoded paths were problematic (e.g. ""<code>C:\Program Files</code>"" becoming ""<code>C:\Program Files (x86)</code>""). Fortunately, there is a <code>%ProgramFiles%</code> environment variable which maps to the proper directory based on the source process (32-bit or 64-bit). So I updated the build scripts with <code>%ProgramFiles%</code>, and I was sure it'd be the end of that.</p>

<p>The build environment is called from the command-line (<code>C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe</code>).</p>

<p><b>The problem:</b>
On one specific machine (namely my dev machine at work), it turns out that <code>C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe</code> is actually a 32bit process, so the scripts find the <code>x86</code> version of the <code>Program Files</code> directory and everything works great.</p>

<p>On every other 64bit machine I can find (including my home machine), <code>C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe</code> is the 64bit version, and the 32bit version is in <code>C:\Windows\SysWow64\cmd.exe</code>. So the build scripts can't find anything they're looking for and fail.</p>

<p>I understand now that the 32bit <code>cmd.exe</code> should be called explicitly if that's what you need, and by default you get a 64bit <code>cmd.exe</code>. Typical case of <code>WORKSFORME</code>...</p>

<p><b>The question is</b>, what happened to the machine where this is not true? Why am I getting a 32bit <code>cmd.exe</code> by default on one machine but not on others? In all cases I am explicitly executing <code>C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe</code> from the <code>Start|Run</code> menu but getting different results <em>on one machine only</em>. All are running the same edition of Vista 64bit.</p>

<p>Any thoughts or insight?</p>

<p>(*) Please accept that I <em>must</em> do this. I am not at liberty to say <em>why</em> I am doing this. Re-installing the OS and everything from scratch would probably work, but it is surely overkill. Besides, it was hard enough convincing our IT department to give out Vista machines!</p>

The server had BizTalk installed on it before, and it was working fine.  I've uninstalled BizTalk, removed the databases and jobs from the SQL server, which is a separate machine, and re-installed BizTalk.  The install was successful, with no errors during the install, and nothing in the install logs.  </p>

<p>I'm configuring the BizTalk server to be the SSO master secret server, along with creating a new BizTalk group and registering the BizTalk runtime.  The process always errors out on creating the SSO database on the SQL server.  In the ConfigLog, there are a couple of warnings that the <code>MSSQLServerOLAPService does not exist</code>, then it shows errors on creating the SSO database.  There are 4 in a row.  In order, they are:</p>

<pre><code>Error ConfigHelper] [DBNETLIB][ConnectionOpen (Connect()).]SQL Server does not exist or access denied.
Error ConfigHelper] SQL error: 08001 Native error code: 17
Error ConfigHelper] c:\depotsetupv2\private\common\configwizard\confighelper\sqlhelper.cpp(1176): FAILED hr = 80004005
Error ConfigHelper] c:\depotsetupv2\private\common\configwizard\confighelper\sqlhelper.cpp(918): FAILED hr = 80004005
</code></pre>

<p>It then has similar errors trying to create each of the BizTalk databases.</p>

<p>On the SQL server, there are corresponding errors in the SQL Server Logs - 2 for each attempt
Login failed for user '[USERNAME]'.[CLIENT: [IP ADDRESS]]
Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 16</p>

<p>The first error from the SQL logs also shows up as a failure audit in the SQL server's application event log.</p>

<p>The biggest issue I am having with this is that the user I am logged on to the BizTalk server is a local admin on both the BizTalk server and the SQL server, and is in the SQL sysadmin group.  The user that I am configuring the BizTalk services to run under is also a local admin on both servers and in the sysadmin group on the SQL server.   I've checked the MSDTC settings on both machines and made sure they are set as the BizTalk documentation recommends.  SQL Browser is running on the SQL machine, and I've verified that network access is allowed using the SQL Surface Area Configuration tool.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me find something that I might have missed?</p>

<p>Re: Igal:</p>

<p>Yes, all of the servers and users are on the same domain.  I've run across that posting on SQL protocols in researching this, but I tried to select a count from one of the tables in the default database of the logged in user while connected to another database.  I had no problems at all running that query.</p>

<p>Re: Yossi:</p>

<p>I'm installing BizTalk on Windows Server 2003 R2 SP1.  Yes, I have removed the SSODB (Wouldn't out it past myself to miss something like that though!).  I will make sure I am providing the usernames correctly and check out the sources you linked and get back to you.</p>

<p>I would like to build a custom tag, which can produce multiple copies of its children.
Ultimately I intend to build a tag similar to  in JSP/Struts.</p>

<p>But the first hurdle I have is the ability to duplicate/clone the contents of a control.</p>

<p>Consider this rather contrived example;</p>

<pre><code>&lt;custom:duplicate count=""2""&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some html&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;asp:TextBox id=""tb1"" runat=""server"" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/custom:duplicate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The HTML markup which is output would be something like,</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some html&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" id=""tb1"" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some html&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" id=""tb1"" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note: I know i have the id duplicated, I can come up with a solution to that later!</em></p>

<p>So what we would have is my custom control with 3 children (I think) - a literal control, a TextBox control, and another literal control.</p>

<p>In this example I have said 'count=2' so what the control should do is output/render its children twice.</p>

<p>What I would hope to do is write some ""OnInit"" code which does something like:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;WebControl&gt; clones;
for(int i=1; i&lt;count; i++)
{
    foreach(WebControl c in Controls) 
    {
        WebControl clone = c.Clone();
        clones.Add(clone);
    }
}

Controls.AddRange(clones);
</code></pre>

<p>However, as far as I can tell, WebControls do not implement ICloneable, so its not possible to clone them in this way.</p>

<p>Any ideas how I can clone WebControls?</p>
