<p>The client now wants, after someone is logged in, to ""keep"" them logged in on that computer for an indefinite amount of time.</p>

<p>ASP.net Sessions have a maximum idle time of 1 day, I believe.  The website isn't written all that well in the Flash portion (whole front end is flash) and the flash will process a login, then, as long as the flash isn't reloaded, assume that the user is still ""logged in"".</p>

<p>I think my solution is to ALSO store a client side cookie with some GUID value and hold in the database the associated user id...sort of like a session that never expires.  So, when the page is loaded, I can check my cookie, use that to select the userid out of the database, and if we find one, then set the session value that says user 23 is logged in.</p>

<p>I want to open a temporary file which will always be deleted upon program termination.  I could understand that in the case of a program crash it may not be practical to guarantee this, but in any other case I'd like it to work.</p>

<p>I know about RAII.  I know about signals.  I know about <code>atexit(3)</code>.  I know I can open the file and delete it immediately and the file will remain accessible until the file descriptor is closed (which even handles a crash).  None of these seem like a complete and straightforward solution:</p>

<ol>
<li>RAII: been there, done that: I have an object whose destructor deletes the file, but the destructor is not called if the program is terminated by a signal.</li>
<li>signals: I'm writing a low-level library which makes registering a signal handler a tricky proposition.  For example, what if the application uses signals itself?  I don't want to step on any toes.  I might consider some clever use of <code>sigaction(2)</code> to cope...but haven't put enough thought into this possibility yet.</li>
<li><code>atexit(3)</code>: apparently useless, since it isn't called during abnormal termination (e.g. via a signal).</li>
<li>preemptive <code>unlink(2)</code>: this is pretty good except that I need the file to remain visible in the filesystem (otherwise the system is harder to monitor/troubleshoot).</li>
</ol>

<p>What would you do here?</p>

<p><strong>Further Explanation</strong></p>

<p>I elided one detail in my original post which I now realize I should have included.  The ""file"" in this case is not strictly a normal file, but rather is a POSIX Message Queue.  I create it via <code>mq_open()</code>.  It can be closed via <code>mq_close()</code> or <code>close()</code> (the former is an alias for the latter on my system).  It can be removed from the system via <code>mq_unlink()</code>.  All of this makes it analogous to a regular file, <em>except</em> that I cannot choose the directory in which the file resides.  This makes the current most popular answer (placing the file in <code>/tmp</code>) unworkable, because the ""file"" is created by the system in a virtual filesystem with very limited capacity.  (I've mounted the virtual filesystem in <code>/dev/mqueue</code>, following the example in <code>man mq_overview</code>) .</p>

<p>This also explains why I need the name to remain visible (making the immediate-unlink approach unworkable): the ""file"" must be shared between two or more processes.</p>

<p>As a follow-up question, does anyone know of a non-intrusive way to solve what i'm trying to do below (namely, linking objects to each other without triggering infinite loops)?</p>

<hr>

<p>I try to create a asp.net-mvc web application, and get a StackOverFlowException. A controller triggers the following command:</p>

<pre><code>    public ActionResult ShowCountry(int id)
    {
        Country country = _gameService.GetCountry(id);
        return View(country);
    }

<p>The GameService handles it like this (WithCountryId is an extension):</p>

<pre><code>    public Country GetCountry(int id)
    {
        return _gameRepository.GetCountries().WithCountryId(id).SingleOrDefault();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The GameRepository handles it like this:</p>

<pre><code>    public IQueryable&lt;Country&gt; GetCountries()
    {
        var countries =  from c in _db.Countries
               select new Country
               {
                   Id = c.Id,
                   Name = c.Name,
                   ShortDescription = c.ShortDescription,
                   FlagImage = c.FlagImage,
                   Game = GetGames().Where(g =&gt; g.Id == c.GameId).SingleOrDefault(),
                   SubRegion = GetSubRegions().Where(sr =&gt; sr.Id == c.SubRegionId).SingleOrDefault(),
               };
        return countries;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The GetGames() method causes the StackOverflowException:</p>

<pre><code>    public IQueryable&lt;Game&gt; GetGames()
    {
        var games = from g in _db.Games                   
               select new Game
               {
                   Id = g.Id,
                   Name = g.Name

               };
        return games;

    }

<p>My Business objects are different from the linq2sql classes, that's why I fill them with a select new.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>edit #1:</strong> I have found the culprit, it's the following method, it triggers the GetCountries() method which in return triggers the GetSubRegions() again, ad nauseam:</p>

<pre><code>    public IQueryable&lt;SubRegion&gt; GetSubRegions()
    {
        return from sr in _db.SubRegions
               select new SubRegion
               {
                   Id = sr.Id,
                   Name = sr.Name,
                   ShortDescription = sr.ShortDescription,
                   Game = GetGames().Where(g =&gt; g.Id == sr.GameId).SingleOrDefault(),
                   Region = GetRegions().Where(r =&gt; r.Id == sr.RegionId).SingleOrDefault(),
                   Countries = new LazyList&lt;Country&gt;(GetCountries().Where(c =&gt; c.SubRegion.Id == sr.Id))

<p>A) Take the code from the app, rebrand it by changing the name and/or logo and, <em>without</em> modifying a single line of code, sell it to people as a hosted service?  Would I have to say something like ""We are using <code>Project X</code>"" with a link to its site?  Or does nobody have to know that I'm using an open-source application unless I want them to?</p>

<p>B) Change the structure of the application, add in my own stuff (an extra module that the original app doesn't have, for instance) and not merge the code back into the main branch <strong>if</strong> the app will only ever be hosted, and not distributed to people?</p>

<p>C) Scrap the front-end entirely and write my own using another technology (Flex, for instance) but use the existing code (possibly modified as with scenario B above) as the back-end?</p>

<p>Can I do any of these?  All of them?  I'm really not 100% sure but it seems a shame to have to reinvent the wheel if there's an open source app that already does most of what my project would do; it seems a lot easier to be able to take that and add onto it to provide a better solution.</p>

<p>I've seen it used in our team's code once or twice.  In your experience, what does this construct enable?  Do other pointer languages have similar constructs?

All of the examples I've seen of this, however, deal with refactoring implementation - changing an algorithm with a more efficient one, for example. </p>

<p>I find that refactoring architecture is a lot more common in the early stages where the design is still being worked out. Interfaces change, new classes are added &amp; deleted, even the behavior of a function could change slightly (I thought I needed it to do this, but it actually needs to do that), etc... But if each test case is tightly coupled to these unstable classes, wouldn't you have to be constantly rewriting your test cases each time you change a design? </p>

<p>Under what situations in TDD is it okay to alter and delete test cases? How can you be sure that altering the test cases don't break them? Plus it seems that having to synchronize a comprehensive test suite with constantly changing code would be a pain. I understand that the unit test suite could help tremendously during maintenance, once the software is built, stable, and functioning, but that's late in the game wheras TDD is supposed to help early on as well.</p>

<p>Lastly, would a good book on TDD and/or refactoring address these sort of issues? If so, which would you recommend?</p>

I have the URL of the file to capture, but can't seem to get the security issue resolved.  Here's the code from the <a href=""http://groovy.codehaus.org/Simple+file+download+from+URL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cookbook samples page</a>:</p>

<pre><code>def download(address)
{
    def file = new FileOutputStream(address.tokenize(""/"")[-1])
    def out = new BufferedOutputStream(file)
    out &lt;&lt; new URL(address).openStream()
    out.close()
}
</code></pre>

<p>and here's my ""memory"" version of the same function which should return a byte array of the file's contents:</p>

<pre><code>def downloadIntoMem(address)
{  // btw, how frickin powerful is Groovy to do this in 3 lines (or less)
        def out = new ByteArrayOutputStream()
        out &lt;&lt; new URL(address).openStream()
        out.toByteArray()
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I try this against an unsecured URL (pick any image file you can find on the net), it works just fine.  However, if I pick a URL that requires a user/password, no go.  </p>

<p>All right, done a bit more work on this.  It seems that the Authenticator method <strong>does</strong> work, but in a round-about way.  The first time I access the URL, I get a 302 response with a location to a login server.  If I access that location with an Authenticator set, then I get another 302 with a Cookie and the location set back to the original URL.  If I then access the original, the download occurs correctly.</p>

<p>So, I have to mimic a browser a bit, but eventually it all works.</p>

<p>Making this a community wiki, so others can add other methods.</p>

<p>2) If I hardcode the values in the beginning and run the app it works. I only get the said error when I try to reference the values from xml. </p>

<p>3) I have searched quite a bit on this topic on google and stackexchange and have tried several approaches suggested on the stackexchange links such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>creating and calling a method like below. I get that same error inside this method.</p>

<pre><code>public String getStringResourceByName(String resourceName) {
    String packageName = ""com.android.example.helloworld"";
    Log.i(""-- package name --"",packageName);
    int resId = this.getResources().getIdentifier(resourceName, ""string"", packageName);
    String resName = getString(resId);
    Log.i(""-- resource name -- "",resName);
    return resName;
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Using MainActivity.this specifically in the above method </p>

<pre><code>public String getStringResourceByName(String resourceName) {
    String packageName = ""com.android.example.helloworld"";
    Log.i(""-- package name --"",packageName);
    int resId = MainActivity.this.getResources().getIdentifier(resourceName, ""string"", packageName);
    String resName = getString(resId);
    Log.i(""-- resource name -- "",resName);
    return resName;
 }

<p>All of the changes throw the same error back at me.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>However, there is also a requirement for data <code>security</code>. That is, what information is visible to an end user.</p>

<p>This effectively means reducing visibility to rows (and perhaps even columns) in the database.</p>

<p>We are using Hibernate for our persistence. However, we are using our own annotations so as not to expose our persistence choice to the business domain experts. </p>

<p>For row based security this means we could add an annotation such as <code>@Secured</code> at the entity level, which would cause an extra column to be added to the underlying table to constrain our selects?</p>

<p>For column based security, we could perhaps have <code>@Secured</code> to either assist in query generation, or perhaps use an aspect to filter the information returned?</p>

<p>I'm curious to know how this might affect hibernate's caching mechanisms as well?</p>

At first everything was great.  I assigned the VPC 512MB and did my work as usual.  I also run Resharper and Visual SVN.  Lately, the act of scrolling in a page causes the CPU to spike above 50, sometimes near 100.  This freezes my machine occasionally and is frustrating.  Typing code sometimes does the same thing.</p>

<p>I have experimented with changing allocated memory, disk space, turning on/off the paging file, uninstalling ReSharper and Visual SVN.  There should be no reason this thing is slow with all the memory I have on this laptop!  I don't have anything running on it but VPC at any one time.</p>

<p>I want to have a method where I can say ""if it goes bad, come back with this type of Exception"", right?</p>

<p>For example, something like (<strong>and this doesn't work</strong>):</p>

<pre><code>    static ExType TestException&lt;ExType&gt;(string message) where ExType:Exception
    {
        Exception ex1 = new Exception();
        ExType ex = new Exception(message);
        return ex;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now whats confusing me is that we <em>KNOW</em> that the generic type is going to be of an Exception type due to the <em>where</em> clause. However, the code fails because we cannot implicitly cast <em>Exception</em> to <em>ExType</em>. We cannot explicitly convert it either, such as:</p>

<pre><code>    static ExType TestException&lt;ExType&gt;(string message) where ExType:Exception
    {
        Exception ex1 = new Exception();
        ExType ex = (ExType)(new Exception(message));
        return ex;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>As that fails too.. So <strong>is this kind of thing possible?</strong> I have a strong feeling its going to be real simple, but I am having a tough day with the old noggin, so cut me some slack :P</p>

<p>OK, so <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41397/asking-a-generic-method-to-throw-specific-exception-type-on-fail#41398"">Vegard</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41397/asking-a-generic-method-to-throw-specific-exception-type-on-fail#41404"">Sam</a> got me on to the point where I could instantiate the correct type, but then obviously got stuck because the <em>message</em> param is read-only following instantiation.</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41397/asking-a-generic-method-to-throw-specific-exception-type-on-fail#41408"">Matt</a> hit the nail right on the head with his response, I have tested this and all works fine. Here is the example code:</p>

<pre><code>    static ExType TestException&lt;ExType&gt;(string message) where ExType:Exception, new ()
    {
        ExType ex = (ExType)Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(ExType), message);
        return ex;

Sure, I can use the out-of-the-box RichTextEditor and TextArea controls, but both tend to choke on displaying and manipulating simple markup (e.g., single or absent quotes on attributes, image alignment, etc.), and the content it generates by default, while beautifully rendered in the Flash player, usually looks ridiculous in the browser -- an important factor to me, since I'd like to continue publishing RSS.</p>

<p>I know there are a couple of RichTextEditor derivatives out there, but before heading down the road with any of them, or down the alternative road of manipulating the content manually, I figured I'd poll the group here first, to see whether anyone's tackled this problem before; it seems like it has to be a fairly common use case.</p>

However, this causes some problems.</p>

<p>In some cases, a DOM node should only be visible when Javascript is enabled in the browser.  In other cases, it should only be visible when disabled.  Take for instance a submit button on a form that has a drop down with an onchange handler that auto-submits (using JQuery's form plugin):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form method=""post"" action="".""&gt;
    &lt;label for=""id_state""&gt;State:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;select name=""state"" id=""id_state"" onchange=""$(this.form).ajaxSubmit(ajax_submit_handler);""&gt;
        &lt;option value=""AL""&gt;Alabama&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;option value=""AK""&gt;Alaska&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;input class=""with_js_disabled"" type=""submit"" value=""OK"" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    $(document).ready(function()
    {
        $("".with_js_disabled"").hide();
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When Javascript is enabled, the submit button is not required (due to the onchange handler).  However, JQuery's $(document).ready function (and the more direct document.onload) is only called after the page has been fully loaded and rendered - hence, the submit button is initially displayed and a ""flash"" occurs when the Javascript is executed and the node's display is set to ""none"".</p>

<p>I've accepted this as the cost of doing business, and haven't found a way around it.  But is there a technique I'm not aware of that will minimize the effect, or even outright eliminate it?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>The <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> solution mentioned by many people below seems promising, but isn't working for me on Safari.  However Prestaul's 2nd suggestion works beautifully:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
        document.body.className += ' has_js';
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;!-- the rest of your page --&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This can then be styled using straight CSS:</p>

<pre><code>body .js_enabled_only { display: none; }
body .js_disabled_only { display: block; }
body.has_js .js_enabled_only { display: block; }
body.has_js .js_disabled_only { display: none; }
</code></pre>

<p>This second line is just for reference and can (and should) be removed to avoid circumstances where your element shouldn't be display:block.  Likewise, you may need different variations on the third line for other display styles.  But this solution is nice and clean, IMO, and in my tests entirely eliminates the flicker effect.</p>

I'm interested in binding to an NSDictionaryController (I don't think I need an intermediate NSArrayController but if that is the best way, I'm open to it). </p>

<p>I've created a controller object that has a property 'db' which has a property 'species' which is an NSMutableDictionary. The 'species' dictionary has ID's for keys and Species objects for values. Species objects have a description property. In InterfaceBuilder, I've created MyController, NSDictionaryController, and an NSPopupButton. I would like to populate the popup with Species.descriptions. When selected, I need access to the corresponding ID.</p>

<p>I've setup the NSDictionaryController to bind 'Content Dictionary' to MyController with Model Key Path 'db.species'. With NSPopupButton, so far I've bound 'Content Values' to NSDictionaryController with controller key 'arrangedObjects' and Model Key Path set to 'value.description'.</p>

<p>This seems to work getting the list populated. My main question is what the best way to wire up the selection is. Ideally, I would like to wire selection to the NSDictionaryController so that I can use the NSDictionaryController to access the selection. One reason for this is so that I can wire other controls to the NSDictionaryController to see the current selection. If not, should I wire to a property in MyController or something? Just looking for the best practices. I would like as much to be through the Interface Builder mechanisms so that I can easily reuse the model and controller design in another application with a different view.</p>

<p><strong>Update using Brian's answer as guidance:</strong></p>

<p>NSPopupButton:
bind Content to NSDictionaryController->arrangedObjects->value.description</p>

<p>bind Content Objects to NSDictionaryController->arrangedObjects->key</p>

<p>bind Selected Index to NSDictionaryController->selectionIndex</p>

<p>bind NSDictionaryController->db.species</p>

<p>Everything seems to work. I can grab the object from the controller with [[[controller selectedObjects] lastObject] value]. It's in an array of selected objects with key, value pairs, I believe.</p>

I've deleted my source tree and checked out of source control fresh.
The error persists.</p>

<p>The Entitlements.plist file has been there for a couple of weeks, since I started my last beta programme. I can't be sure, but I suspect I had not compiled on my second dev machine since it was added. However, as well as my primary dev machine, it also all builds fine on my colleagues machine, so I'm baffled what the difference can be.</p>

<p>I've Googled for the error, but either my Google-Fu is bunk or this is not a common error - I've found no relevant hits.</p>

<p>I have 1 UINavigationController and 2 subclasses of UIViewController.</p>

<p>I have a MainWindow.xib file, a PersonListView.xib, and a PersonDetailView.xib.</p>

<p>The MainWindow.xib has the UINavigationController with the view linked over to the PersonListView.xib file.</p>

<p>The PersonListView.xib has the File's Owner listed as a PersonListViewController class.</p>

<p>I have some buttons on the PersonListView, along with labels and images.  All displays correctly.</p>

<p>When I try to link a button on the PersonListView to my PersonListViewController class, the button is not firing....</p>

<p>The result:
 <strong>* Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*</strong> -[UIViewController viewDetail]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x450d50'</p>

<p>If I go into the debug console and print-object 0x450d50, I get:</p>

<p>(gdb) print-object 0x450d50

(gdb) </p>

<p>The Interface Builder correctly shows the File's Owner as a PersonListViewController, so why would my button action (linked to the File's Owner) go to the superclass somehow?</p>

<p>EDIT1: Ok, what seems to be happening is that I wasn't getting an instance of the subclass unless, in my MainWindow.xib, I explicitly set the class of the view controller to my subclass.</p>

<p>There's still got to be something I'm missing, though, because surely I should be able to start up arbitrary subclasses of UIViewController just by swapping out the NIB file name from the main window?</p>

<p>EDIT2: (Response to Kevin)
That's not what I'm saying regarding the contents of a XIB.  </p>

<p>I have 3 XIBs:</p>

<p>MainWindow
PeopleListView
PeopleDetailView</p>

<p>The PeopleListView and PeopleDetailView each have an associated File's Owner that is a corresponding UIViewController subclass.  Obviously, I need my events to go to the right controller classes as I move from page to page...but if I can only use a default UIViewController or one subclass, that will be much more difficult?</p>

<p>I can get the correct effect in code by manually setting up the UINavigationController with the correct root, but I feel like there should be a better way through InterfaceBuilder.</p>

<p>EDIT3: (to Kendall)
I'm not using a tab bar.  The model is the same, though, that the view in my navigation controller has to be wired to a single subclass, which seems a bit icky.</p>

<p>EDIT4: (to lostintransit)
The PersonListViewController has the appropriate - (IBAction) viewDetail; method.  The problem is that I can't find a way, in my MainWindow.xib, to flag the view inside my UINavigationController as ""initially load this from PersonListView.xib, with a PersonListViewController as the view"" that wouldn't make it difficult to replace the PersonListView with a PersonDetailView.</p>

<p>The carp warning works fine - I am checking if an input parameter meets a certain condition - if it does not meet the condition, a warning is sent with carp and the module continues on using a default for the parameter instead of the one the calling program passed.  The warning is just to notify that a default parameter is being used instead of the passed in parameter.</p>

<p>My problem is with my test script.  My test script is sending in a bad parameter to the module, and I am trying to catch the warning message that comes back and make sure I got the correct warning message.</p>

<p>My module looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>else {
  carp ""value must be numeric - using default value"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>and my test script looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>eval {
  #call to my module
};
like (
    $@,
    qr/value must be numeric/,
    ""Should abort on non-numeric value""
);
</code></pre>

<p>When I run the test, I can see the warning (it must be going to STDERR) on the screen, but the contents of the $@ variable is '' - blank.</p>

<p>Here is the output from my test script:</p>

<pre><code>t/04bad_method_calls....ok 10/12value must be numeric - using default value at ...
#   Failed test 'Should abort on non-numeric value'
#   at t/04bad_method_calls.t line 98.
t/04bad_method_calls....NOK 12
#                   '' doesn't match '(?-xism:value must be numeric)'
# Looks like you failed 1 test of 12.
</code></pre>

<p>If I change the carp to a croak, my test script works - it catches the error message (but I only want to warn, not abort).</p>

<p>To be honest, I don't have the best understanding of eval - maybe that is not the best way to catch the warning output from carp.  I tried using $SIG{<strong>WARN</strong>}, but that was empty as well.</p>

<p>Is there any way to capture the output from carp?  It's not the biggest deal since this is just in my test script, but I'd still like to get my test script to work properly.</p>

Everything I've found so far either uses NetBeans, or they're running a one-file project in Eclipse (witch won't work for larger projects). Idealy, I'm looking for somebody who's set up a simple Ant script that builds a JavaFX project, since I assume that's the end-game for this situation.</p>

It provides syntax highlighting support, plus some ""snippets"". I can even use it to run simple hello world type JavaFX apps, but I cant seem to get it to automatically build multi-file JavaFX projects. Even if I could, I still can't seem to write a correct ant script to jar up the JavaFX project.</p>

<p>Also, I found <a href=""http://jfx.wikia.com/wiki/Ant_task"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this site</a> that talks about what you can do to use a <em>javafxc</em> Ant task created by Sun(?), but I'm not having any luck trying to use what they talk about.</p>

<p>I've setup a cherrypy upload/POST handler for our receiver end.  I've managed to allow it to do arbitrary number of parameters using multipart/form-data.  However when we try to send the multipart-mixed data, we're not getting any processing.</p>

<pre><code>@cherrypy.expose
def upload(self, *args,**kwargs):
    """"""upload adapted from cherrypy tutorials

    We use our variation of cgi.FieldStorage to parse the MIME

        lcHDRS[key.lower()] = val
    incomingBytes = int(lcHDRS['content-length'])

    print cherrypy.request.rfile 

    #etc..etc...
</code></pre>

<p>So, when submitting multipart/form-data, args and kwargs are well defined.<br>
args are the form fields, kwargs=hash of vars and values.
When I submit multipart/mixed, args and kwargs are empty, and I just have cherrypy.request.rfile as the raw POST information.  </p>

<p>My question is, does cherrypy have a built in handler to handle multipart/mixed and chunked encoding for POST?  Or will I need to override the cherrypy.tools.process_request_body and roll my own decoder?</p>

<p>It seems like the builtin wsgi server with cherrypy handles this as part of the HTTP/1.1 spec, but I could not seem to find documentation in cherrypy in accessing this functionality.</p>

<hr>

<p>...to clarify</p>

<p>I'm using latest version 3.1.1 or so of Cherrypy.</p>

<p>Making a default form just involves making parameters in the upload function.</p>

<p>For the multipart/form-data, I've been calling curl -F param1=@file1.jpg -F param2=sometext -F param3=@file3.wav <a href=""http://destination:port/upload"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://destination:port/upload</a></p>

<p>In that example, I get:</p>

<pre><code>args = ['param1','param2','param3] 
kwargs = {'param1':CString&lt;&gt;, 'param2': 'sometext', 'param3':CString&lt;&gt;}
</code></pre>

<p>When trying to submit the multipart/mixed, I tried looking at the request.body, but kept on getting None for that, regardless of setting the body processing.</p>

<p>The input we're getting is coming in as this:</p>

<pre><code>user-agent:UNTRUSTED/1.0 Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.1
content-language:en-US
content-length:565719
mime-version:1.0
content-type:multipart/mixed; boundary='newdivider'
host:192.168.1.1:8180
transfer-encoding:chunked



--newdivider
Content-type: text/xml

&lt;?xml version='1.0' ?&gt;&lt;data&gt;&lt;Stuff&gt;....
etc...etc...

--newdivider
Content-type: image/jpeg
Content-ID: file://localhost/root1/photos/Garden.jpg
Content-transfer-encoding: binary

&lt;binary data&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I've got a sneaking suspicion that the multipart/mixed is the problem that cherrypy is just giving me just the rfile. Our goal is to have cherrypy process the body into its parts with minimal processing on the receive side (ie, let cherrypy do its magic). If that requires us being tougher on the sending format to be a content-type that cherrypy likes, then so be it. What are the accepted formats? Is it only multipart/form-data?</p>

This in itself is not a problem for a single file, a simple <em>while ((got = fs.Read(piece, 0, pieceLength)) > 0)</em> gets the job done perfectly fine. The last piece of the file may be smaller than desired, which is fine.</p>

<p>Now, there is a tricky bit: If I have multiple files, I need to have one continous stream, which means that if the last piece of a file is smaller that pieceLength, then I need to read (pieceLength-got) of the next file, and then keep on going on until the end of the last file.</p>

<p>So essentially, given X files, I will always read pieces that are exactly pieceLength long, except for the very last piece of the very last file, which may be smaller.</p>

<p>I just wonder if there is already something build in .net (3.5 SP1) that does the trick. My current approach is to create a Class that takes a list of files and then exposes a <code>Read(byte[] buffer, long index, long length)</code> function, similar to FileStream.Read(). This should be pretty straight forward because I do not have to change my calling code that reads the data, but before I reinvent the wheel I'd just like to double check that the wheel is not already built into the BCL.</p>

Basically the idea is to open the file as a stream and then to ""write"" the file stream to the reponse, specifying the content type and content disposition headers.  Content disposition is used to preserve the file name, content type of course to clue the browser about what app to open to view the file.  </p>

<p>This works all good and fine in a development environment and UAT environment.  However, in the production environment, things do not always work as expected,however only with IE6/IE7. FF works great in all environments. </p>

<p>Note that in the production environment SSL is enabled and generally used.  (When SSL is not used in the production environment, file streams, is named as expected, and properly dislays.)</p>

<p>Here is a code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>System.IO.FileStream fs = new System.IO.FileStream(Server.MapPath(""."") + ""\\"" + ""test.doc"", System.IO.FileMode.Open);
long byteNum = fs.Length;
byte[] pdfBytes = new byte[byteNum];
fs.Read(pdfBytes, 0, (int)byteNum);

Response.AppendHeader(""Content-disposition"", ""filename=Testme.doc"");
Response.CacheControl = ""no-cache"";
Response.ContentType = ""application/msword; charset=utf-8"";
Response.Expires = -1;
Response.OutputStream.Write(pdfBytes, 0, pdfBytes.Length);
Response.Flush();
Response.Close();
fs.Close();
</code></pre>

<p>Like I said, this code snippet works fine on the dev machine and in the UAT environment.  A dialog box opens and asks to save, view or cancel Testme.doc.  But in production onnly when using SSL, IE 6 &amp; IE7 don't use the name of the attachment.  Instead it uses the name of the page that is sending the stream, testheader.apx and then an error is thrown.  </p>

<p>IE does provide an advanced setting ""Do not save encrypted pages to disk"".  </p>

<p>I suspect this is part of the problem, the server tells the browser not to cache the file, while IE has the ""Do not save encrypted pages to disk"" enabled.</p>

<p>Yes I am aware that for larger files, the code snippet above will be a major drag on memory and this implimentation will be problematic. So the real final solution will not open the entire file into a single byte array, but rather will open the file as a stream, and then send the file down to the client in bite size chunks (e.g. perhaps roughly 10K in size).</p>

<p>Anyone else have similar experience ""streaming"" binary files over ssl?  Any suggestions or recommendations?</p>

{
    public static void RunSnippet()
    {

<blockquote>
  <p>""The type or namespace name 'HashSet'
  could not be found (are you missing a
  using directive or an assembly
  reference?)""</p>

<p>Clearly I'm not. It seems it can't find HashSet, yet it finds other types in the Systems.Collections.Generic namespace (e.g. List, SortedDictionary).</p>

<p>What's the explanation for this? Presumeably Snippet Compiler is just using the standard Framework compiler under the covers...</p>

#define TEXTURE_HEIGHT 512

GLubyte textureArray[TEXTURE_HEIGHT][TEXTURE_WIDTH][4];

<p>How do I change that so that there's no need for TEXTURE_WIDTH and TEXTURE_HEIGHT? Perhaps I could use a pointer style array and dynamically allocate the memory...</p>

<h3>Edit:</h3>

<p>I think I see the problem, in C++ it can't really be done. The work around as pointed out by Budric is to use a single dimensional array but use all 3 dimensions multiplied to represent what would be the indexes:</p>

<pre><code>GLbyte *array = new GLbyte[xMax * yMax * zMax];
</code></pre>

<p>And to access, for example x/y/z of 1/2/3, you'd need to do:</p>

<pre><code>GLbyte byte = array[1 * 2 * 3];
</code></pre>

<p>However, the problem is, I don't think the <code>glTexImage2D</code> function supports this. Can anyone think of a workaround that would work with this OpenGL function?</p>

<h3>Edit 2:</h3>

<p>Attention OpenGL developers, this can be overcome by using a single dimensional array of pixels...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[0]: column 0 > [1]: row 0 > [2]: channel 0 ... n > [n]: row 1 ... n > [n]: column 1 .. n</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... no need to use a 3 dimensional array. In this case I've had to use this work around as 3 dimensional arrays are apparently not strictly possible in C++.</p>

<p>I've added every assembly reference I could find, to no effect.</p>

<p>Finally, this is what I have hacked together and it works, but perhaps you good readers could suggest a better solution:</p>

<p>1) In my test project, the class name of a test case that I want to debug is MyTestClass.  It has a [TestFixtureSetUp] method named Init() and the actual test case is in [Test] function MyTest()</p>

<p>2) In my code project, I have a console program TestProgram.cs which compiles to an EXE.</p>

<p>In TestProgram.cs, I call the test cases in the following way</p>

<pre><code>// First instantiate the test class
MyTestClass tc = new MyTestClass();

// Call the TestFixtureSetup method
tc.Init();

// Now call the actual test
tc.MyTest();

"634926","1","635000","","2009-03-11 15:01:08","","2","5060","<p><b>Background:</b> I'm using the SlimDX C# wrapper for DirectX, and am drawing many 2D sprites using the Sprite class (traditionally from the Direct3DX extension in the underlying dlls).  I'm drawing multiple hundreds of sprites to the screen at once, and the performance is awesome -- on my quad core, it's using something like 3-6% of the processor for my entire game, including logic for 10,000+ objects, ai routines on a second thread, etc, etc.  So clearly the sprites are being drawing using full hardware acceleration, and everything is as it should be.</p>

<p><b>Issue:</b> The problem comes when I start introducing calls to the Line class.  As soon as I draw 4 lines (for a drag selection box), processor usage skyrockets to 13-19%.  This is with only four lines!</p>

<p><b>Things I have tried:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Turning line antialiasing off and on.</li>
<li>Turning GLLines off and on.</li>
<li>Manually calling the line.begin and line.end around my calls to draw.</li>
<li>Omitting all calls to line.begin and line.end.</li>
<li>Ensuring that my calls to line.draw are not inside a sprite.begin / sprite.end block.</li>
<li>Calling line.draw inside a sprite.begin / sprite.end block.</li>
<li>Rendering 4 lines, or rendering 300.</li>
<li>Turning off all sprite and text rendering, and just leaving the line rendering for 4 lines (to see if this was some sort of mode-changing issue).</li>
<li>Most combinations of the above.</li>
</ol>

<p>In general, none of these had a significant impact on performance.  #3 reduced processor usage by maybe 2%, but even then it's still 8% or more higher than it should be.  The strangest thing is that #7 from above had absolutely zero impact on performance -- it was just as slow with 4 lines as it was with 300.  The only thing that I can figure is that this is being run in software for some reason, and/or that it is causing the graphics card to continually switch back and forth between some sort of drawing modes.</p>

<p><b>Matrix Approach:</b></p>

<p>If anyone knows of any fix to the above issue, then I'd love to hear it! </p>

<p>But I'm under the assumption that this might just be an issue inside of directx in general, so I've been pursuing another route -- making my own sprite-based line.  Essentially, I've got a 1px white image, and I'm using the diffuse color and transforms to draw the lines.  This works, performance-wise -- drawing 300 of the ""lines"" like this puts me in the 3-6% processor utilization performance range that I'm looking for on my quad core.</p>

<p>I have two problems with my pixel-stretch line technique, which I'm hoping that someone more knowledgeable about transforms can help me with.  Here's my current code for a horizontal line:</p>

<pre><code>    public void DrawLineHorizontal( int X1, int X2, int Y, float HalfHeight, Color Color )
    {
        float width = ( X2 - X1 ) / 2.0f;
        Matrix m = Matrix.Transformation2D( new Vector2( X1 + width, Y ), 0f, new Vector2( width, HalfHeight ),
            Vector2.Zero, 0, Vector2.Zero );
        sprite.Transform = m;

        sprite.Draw( this.tx, Vector3.Zero, new Vector3( X1 + width, Y, 0 ), Color );
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This works, insofar as it draws lines of mostly the right size at mostly the right location on the screen.  However, things appear shifted to the right, which is strange.  I'm not quite sure if my matrix approach is right at all: I just want to scale a 1x1 sprite by some amount of pixels horizontally, and a different amount vertically.  Then I need to be able to position them -- by the center point is fine, and I think that's what I'll have to do, but if I could position it by upper-left that would be even better.  This seems like a simple problem, but my knowledge of matrices is pretty weak.</p>

<p>This would get purely-horizontal and purely-vertical lines working for me, which is most of the battle.  I could live with just that, and use some other sort of graphic in locations which I am currently using angled lines.  But it would be really nice if there was a way for me to draw lines that are angled using this stretched-pixel approach.  In other words, draw a line from 1,1 to 7,19, for instance.  With matrix rotation, etc, it seems like this is feasible, but I don't know where to even begin other than guessing and checking, which would take forever.</p>

<p>Any and all help is much appreciated!</p>

I've also been reading books on OOP.  I'm coding a web-based database application at work.  While my job title is not ""programmer"", I'm fortunate enough to be able to work on this as a side project.  I coded in Basic in the early 80's and was even good at utilizing pokes and peeks to manipulate the Apple ][ + and the TRS-80 to astound and amaze my friends.  But that was a very linear approach to coding.  </p>

<p>All this being said, something is just not clicking with me.  I haven't had that a-ha moment with either C# or OOP that gives me the ability to sit down, open up VS2008, and start coding.  I have to study other people's code so much that it simply seems like I'm not doing anything on my own.  I'm getting discouraged.</p>

<p>It's not like I'm not capable of it.  I picked up t-sql really quickly.  Someone can tell me what information they want out of the database and I can code out the tsql in a matter of a few minutes to give them what they want.  SQL is something that I get.  This isn't happening for me with OOP or C#.  Granted, C# is inherently more complex, but at some point it has to click.  Right?</p>

<p>Each product can have the following prices:</p>

<ul>
<li>List Price (MSRP)</li>
<li>Cost (what we pay for it)</li>
<li>Retail Price - shown on ""main"" site</li>
<li>Government price (our primary customer is the U.S. Government) - only shown on our government subdmain</li>
<li>Sale Price (valid for 1 month, but extended every month) - only shown on our government subdomain</li>
<li>BPA Price (special price for BPAs) - not shown but loaded onto government sites</li>
</ul>

<p>The list price is provided in the vendor's quarterly data file and kept in the <code>Products</code> table, since it's a finite part of a product entity.  How should I handle the other prices though?  </p>

<p>I'm thinking the best (only?) course of action is to have a separate table with the different price structure as well as <code>SaleStartDate</code> and <code>SaleEndDate</code> columns that I can check to see whether or not to display the sale price.  In fact, I'm not sure of any other way to handle this.</p>

<p>Also, I will need to have a duplicate of this (different prices, but same cost) as our company does the processing (all the work, really) for a different company that's in the same business as us; the products are identical but customers/orders/specific prices are different.  The current implementation has a duplicate database with everything repeated (same with the code) and I want to avoid this like the plague so I'm trying to come up with a way to abstract the common things out.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT (2/17/2009 @ 12:57PM):</strong> Except for the list price, the prices are all calculated based off the cost, however it's not always that easy; sometimes items need to have their prices manually changed independently of the margin, however this is handled manually via Excel and only once per quarter (3 months); when the data is loaded into the database the price is finite and isn't changed until the following quarter; the ""sale"" price is on perpetually forever, but it expires (not on our site, but on several government sites like GSA Advantage) and needs to be extended; it doesn't change though when it's extended.  The sale price is just to have our own site in sync with GSA Advantage, so if a government customer visits our site they'll see identical pricing as they would on Advantage.</p>

<p>RE: The other company, that might be a way to go, although it would be insanely annoying to have to do everything multiple times; the products are exactly the same, the cost is exactly the same (we basically do everything for them, it's another company in name only and the fact they have different customers than we do), but their prices use a different markup than ours.  Everything else is identical, which is why I was hoping to keep stuff like the product information in one table, and then keep the differences in separate tables.  The current system is a mess largely because <strong>everything</strong> (database, code files, images, everything) is duplicated, so refactoring the code in our website requires an identical change made to the other website.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT (2/17/2009 @ 4:52PM):</strong> Some very good ideas so far.  One of the issues is that, apart from reporting purposes and reference, only one of the price columns is ever the ""real"" one.  For example, the government price is <em>always</em> shown to government customers, but the sale price is shown instead if the current date falls during the sale date (""sale"" pricing is specific to government customers).  If the customer is ordering for a BPA (this will be determined by our order processing system and/or manual override by a user), the price is automatically the BPA price.  The list price might be shown to display the discount you are getting, and it's required for reports, but nothing else.</p>

<p>Also, I'm unsure of how badly normalizing things will make updates.  Right now, I'm just handed a spreadsheet with new pricing and told to update the database (since they're all in the products table); I do this based on the product's SKU since the ID is internal only and all of the related tables are linked via the SKU.  With a separate price table it becomes even more unwieldy, although I could still use the SKU as the reference (it's going to be a unique index for a product) but a lot more would have to be done manually.</p>

For example, one common rule of thumb is that every table should have a primary key and that the key should be <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key"" rel=""noreferrer"">devoid of information content</a>.  So I was wondering if anyone had written a book or published papers regarding design patterns for designing relational databases?</p>

<hr>

<p>@Gaius,</p>

<p>That is the question that a database designer needs to weigh--what is the probable stability of the database structure?  Given a long-enough horizon nothing is stable. Or to say the converse, given a long-enough horizon, everything is subject to change.  A surrogate key (in theory) should never change its meaning because it never had meaning to begin with.  </p>

<p>I guess the other thing to consider in that particular design scenario is who is it that will be seeing the primary key?  If the primary key is something that end-users will actually need to refer to then it makes sense to make it something they can understand.  But I can't think of many cases where an end-user needs to see a primary key; usually the primary key is present to allow the DB engine to speed up certain operations.</p>

<p>My original thought in asking the question was to find design patterns for database design that were codified by more experienced database designers than myself so as to, hopefully, avoid some easily avoidable errors.  It would be interesting reading if anyone had ever codified database design anti-patterns. </p>

</ul>

<p>Currently, I use ExcelPackage, which has some really serious drawbacks and issues. As I do not need to create overly complex Excel sheets (the most ""complicated"" thing is that I explicitely need to set a cell type to numeric or text), I 'm looking towards Option 1 next, but I just wonder if there are any other good and supported ways to generate Excel 2007 Sheets? Bonus Points if they can be created without having to save them to the harddrive, i.e. generate and directly output them into a stream.</p>

<p>.net 3.0 is the target here, no 3.5 goodness :(</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thanks so far. The XML SDK is indeed 3.5 only, but Russian Roulet... erm... COM Interop is also something I want to avoid whenever possible, especially since Excel 2007 has a somewhat complicated but still rather easy to create document format. I'll have a look at the various links and hints posted.</p>

<p>Now, I do have Dijkstra's algorithm in the form of:</p>

<pre><code>// Dijkstra's Single-Source Algorithm
private int cheapest(double[] distances, boolean[] visited)

        result[source] = 0; // zero distance from itself

        {
                int node = cheapest(result, visited);
                visited[node] = true;
                for (int j = 0; j &lt; size(); j++)
                {
                        result[j] = Math.min(result[j], result[node] + getCost(node, j));
                }

        }
        return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>With this implementation I can give it a particular node and it will give me a list of all the distances from that node.  So, I could grab the largest distance in that list of distances but I can't be sure that any particular node is one of the two furthest ones at either end.  </p>

<p>So the only solution I can think of is to run this Dijkstra's algorithm on every node, go through each returned list of distances and looking for the largest distance.  After exhausting each node returning it's list of distances I should have the value of the largest distance between any two nodes (the ""road"" distance between the two most widely seperated villages).  There has got to be an easier way to do this because this seems really computationally expensive.  The problem says that there could be sample inputs with up to 500 nodes so I wouldn't want it to take prohibitively long. Is this how I should do it?</p>

<p>Here is a sample input for the problem:</p>

<p>Total Nodes: 5  </p>

<p>Edges:<br>
Nodes 2 - Connect - Node 4.  Distance/Weight 25<br>
Nodes 2 - Connect - Node 5.  Distance/Weight 26<br>
Nodes 3 - Connect - Node 4.  Distance/Weight 16<br>
Nodes 1 - Connect - Node 4.  Distance/Weight 14  </p>

<p>The answer to this sample input is ""67 miles"".  Which is the length of the road between the two most widely separated villages.</p>

<p>So should I do it how I described or is there a much simpler and much less computationally expensive way?</p>

<p>I started by storing the names of all modules in sys.modules that the python interpreter started with and then deleting all new modules from sys.modules when requested.

Say that I have a view which can accept drag and drop, but only in certain areas. Once the user drags over one of these areas I call <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(this)</code> (from a <code>DragEvent.DRAG_OVER</code> handler), but if the user then moves out of this area I'd like to change the status of the drag to not accepted and show the <code>DragManager.NONE</code> feedback. However, neither calling <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(null)</code> nor <code>DragManager.showFeedback(DragManager.NONE)</code> seems to have any effect. Once I've accepted the drag an set the feedback type I can't seem to change it.</p>

<p>Just to make it clear: the areas where the user should be able to drop are not components or even display objects, in fact they are just ranges in the text of a text field (like the selection). Had they been components of their own I could have solved it by making each of them accept drag events individually. I guess I could create proxy components that float over the text to emulate it, but I'd rather not if it isn't necessary.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've managed to get it working in both AIR and the browser now, but only by putting proxy components on top of the ranges of text where you should be able to drop things. That way I get the right feedback and drops are automatically unaccepted on drag exit.</p>

<p>This is the oddest thing about D&amp;D in AIR:</p>

<pre><code>DragManager.doDrag(initiator, source, event, dragImage, offsetX, offsetY);
</code></pre>

<p>In browser-based Flex, <code>offsetX</code> and <code>offsetY</code> should be negative (so says the documentation, and it works fine). However, when running <em>exactly the same code</em> in AIR you have to make the offsets positive. The same numbers, but positive. That is very, very weird.</p>

It seems like drag and drop in AIR is different. It's really, really weird because not only is the feedback not showing correctly, and it's not possible to unaccept, but the coordinates are also completely off. I just tried my application in a browser instead of AIR and dragging and dropping is completely broken.</p>

<p>Also, skipping the <code>dragEnter</code> handler works fine in AIR, but breaks everything when running in a browser.</p>

<p>Suppose you have the following entity.</p>

<pre><code>@Entity

public class TOrder implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 2235742302377173533L;

    }

    public void setActivationDate(Calendar activationDate) {
        this.activationDate = activationDate;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This entity is mapped to Oracle 10g, so in the DB there will be a table T_ORDER with a primary key NUMBER column ""ID"" and a TIMESTAMP column ""activationDate"".</p>

<p>Lets suppose I create an instance of this class with the activation date ""15. Sep 2008 00:00AM"". My local timezone is CEST which is GMT+02:00. When I persist this object and select the data from the table T_ORDER using sqlplus, I find out that in the table actually ""14. Sep 2008 22:00"" is stored, which is ok so far, because the oracle db timezone is GMT.</p>

<p>But now the annoying part. When I read this entity back into my JAVA program, I find out that the oracle time zone is ignored and I get ""14. Sep 2008 22:00 CEST"", which is definitly wrong. </p>

<p>So basically, when writing to the DB the timezone information will be used, when reading it will be ignored.</p>

<p>Is there any solution for this out there? The most simple solution I guess would be to set the oracle dbs timezone to GMT+02, but unfortunatly I can't do this because there are other applications using the same server.</p>

Note that while some of the categories might be well defined, a lot is going to be user defined and might be very messy.</p>

Remembering the nodes I already passed through probably helps avoiding unnecessary repetition, but are there more optimizations?</p>

<p>How do I go about the second one? It seems that the first step would be to determine the height of each node in the set, as to determine at which one(s) to start and then find all paths below that which include the rest of the set. But is this the best (or even a good) approach?</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_traversal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">graph traversal algorithms listed at Wikipedia</a> all seem to be concerned with either finding a particular node or the shortest or otherwise most effective route between two nodes.

Sometimes when we execute multiple searches successively the 2nd or 3rd search will sometimes return results from the first set of search criteria.  </p>

<p>Example: our first search we do a look up on ""John Smith"" -> John Smith results are displayed.  The second search we do a look up on ""Bob Jones"" -> John Smith results are displayed.  </p>

<p>We save all of the search criteria in session state as I said, and read it from session state inside of the ajax request to format the DB query.  When we put break points in VS everything behaves as normal, but without them we get the original search criteria and results.</p>

<p>My guess is because they are saved in session, that the ajax request somehow gets its own session and saves the criteria to that, and then retrieves the criteria from that session every time, but the non-async stuff is able to see when the criteria is modified and saves the changes to state accordingly, but because they are from two different sessions there is a disparity in what is saved and read.</p>

<p>EDIT:::
To elaborate more, there was a suggestion of appending the search criteria to the query string which normally is good practice and I agree thats how it should be but following our requirements I don't see it as being viable.  They want it so the user fills out the input controls hits search and there is no page reload, the only thing they see is a progress indicator on the page, and they still have the ability to navigate and use other features on the current page.  If I were to add criteria to the query string I would have to do another request causing the whole page to load, which depending on the search criteria can take a really long time.  This is why we are using an ajax call to perform the search and why we aren't causing another full page request.....  I hope this clarifies the situation.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong></p>

<p>How do I get the raw information in order to plot the ecdf diagram in another software (e. g. Excel, Matlab, LaTeX)? For the histogram function I can just write</p>

<pre><code>res = hist(...)
</code></pre>

<p>and I find all the information like</p>

<pre><code>res$breaks
res$counts
res$density
res$mids
res$xname
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question 2</strong></p>

<p>How do I calculate the inverse ecdf? Say I want to know how many cars have a speed below 10 mph (the example data is car speed).</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Thanks to the answer of user777 I have more information now. If I use</p>

<pre><code>&gt; myResult(0:25)
 [1] 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.04 0.04 0.04 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.18 0.22 0.30 0.38
[15] 0.46 0.52 0.56 0.62 0.70 0.76 0.86 0.86 0.88 0.90 0.98 1.00
</code></pre>

<p>I get the data for 0 to 25 mph. But I do not know where to draw a data point. I do want to reproduce the R plot exactly.</p>

<p><strong>Here I have a data point every 1 mph.</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gb4gO.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Here I do not have a data pint every 1 mph. I only have a data point if there is data available.</strong></p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<pre><code># Plotting the a built in sample data
plot(cars$speed)
# Assingning the data to a new variable name
myData = cars$speed
# Calculating the edcf
myResult = ecdf(myData)
myResult
# Plotting the ecdf
plot(myResult)
# Have a look on the probability for 0 to 25 mph
myResult(0:25)
# Have a look on the probability but just where there ara data points
myResult(unique(myData))
# Saving teh stuff to a directory
write.csv(cbind(unique(myData), myResult(unique(myData))), file=""D:/myResult.txt"")

What I would like to be able to do is then query over this with Linq to XML so that I can scrape out the bits I need.  I'm using the method described <a href=""http://vijay.screamingpens.com/archive/2008/05/26/linq-amp-lambda-part-3-html-agility-pack-to-linq.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> to parse the HtmlDocument into an XDocument, but when trying to query over this I'm not sure how to handle namespaces.  In one particular document the original HTML was actually poorly formatted XHTML with the following tag:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" xml:lang=""en""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When trying to query from this document it seems that the namespace attribute is preventing me from doing something like:</p>

<pre><code>var x = xDoc.Descendants(""div"");
// returns null
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently for those ""div"" tags only the LocalName is ""div"", but the proper tag name is the namespace plus ""div"".  I have tried to do some research on the issue of XML namespaces and it seems that I can bypass the namespace by querying this way:</p>

<pre><code>var x = 
    (from x in xDoc.Descendants()
     where x.Name.LocalName == ""div""
     select x);
// works
</code></pre>

<p>However, this seems like a rather hacky solution and does not properly address the namespace issue.  As I understand it a proper XML document can contain multiple namespaces and therefore the proper way to handle it should be to parse out the namespaces I'm querying under.  Has anyone else ever had to do this?  Am I just making it way to complicated?  I know that I could avoid all this by just sticking with HtmlDocument and querying with XPath, but I would rather stick to what I know (Linq) if possible and I would also prefer to know that I am not setting myself up for further namespace-related issues down the road.</p>

<p>What is the proper way to deal with namespaces in this situation?</p>

So, in that light, I wrote this.</p>

<pre><code>// Quick, and very dirty
System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes(filename, new byte[f.Length]);
</code></pre>

<p>It works, atleast until you download a file that is several hundred MB's, or potentially even GB's and you throw Windows into a thrashing frenzy if not totally wipe out the pagefile and kill your systems memory altogether. Oops.</p>

<p>So, with a little more enlightenment, I set out with the following algorithm.</p>

<pre><code>using (FileStream outFile = System.IO.File.Create(filename))
{
    // 4194304 = 4MB; loops from 1 block in so that we leave the loop one 
    // block short
    byte[] buff = new byte[4194304];
    for (int i = buff.Length; i &lt; f.Length; i += buff.Length)
    {
        outFile.Write(buff, 0, buff.Length);
    }
    outFile.Write(buff, 0, f.Length % buff.Length);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works, well even, and doesn't suffer the crippling memory problem of the last solution. It's still slow though, especially on older hardware since it writes out (potentially GB's worth of) data out to the disk.</p>

<p>The question is this: Is there a better way of accomplishing the same thing? Is there a way of telling Windows to create a file of x size and simply allocate the space on the filesystem rather than actually write out a tonne of data. I don't care about initialising the data in the file at all (the protocol I'm using - bittorrent - provides hashes for the files it sends, hence worst case  for random uninitialised data is I get a lucky coincidence and part of the file is correct).</p>

<p>I have finally gotten the page to layout as it should across all browsers (all major browsers; Chrome, Opera, Safari, Firefox) except IE 9 and likely its legacy versions. Currently the links stop showing in the 'nav' bar after the second link (which has drop downs). The links are all horizontal safe for the drop down, until it comes to the link third and on they all show below the 'nav' bar and as a vertical list. I am sure the problem requires a separate style sheet for IE but the question is a master style sheet or the menu style sheet, and to what end? </p>

<p>here is a pic of the layout:</p>

/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the block elements. The elements within these blocks have padding on their sides. This saves you from any ""box model math"". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the block itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the block element and place a second block element within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a block set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For blocks where this rule must be broken, you should add a ""display:inline"" declaration to the block element's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar blocks could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the left instead of the right, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all left instead of all right) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the blocks around in the HTML source.

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>As noted ""_HAS_EXCEPTIONS 0"" doesn't turn off exceptions, per se. What it does is, at least in the vector header file, is call _Raise on an exception object instead of calling the C++ ""throw"". In my case, it can't link to the exception object's _Raise function since I am not including the correct library. What that library is, though, is not obvious.</p>

I've also had to work with some Japanese encoding that starts every character with a 0xE3 and is three bytes long.  It displays on my computer properly if I choose the Japanese locale in Windows, however, it doesn't display properly in our application.  However, if any other locale other than Japanese is selected, I cannot even view the filenames properly. So I'm guessing this encoding is not Unicode. Anyone know what it is? Is it ANSI? Is it Shift JIS?</p>

<p>I am attempting to include a second boxplot into an existing boxplot that is ordered by the mean of the values plotted.  When I include the boxplot from the second data.frame (representing a control sample to the other plots), the original plot looses its ordering.</p>

<p>Below is an example:</p>

<pre><code>x1 &lt;- data.frame(""V1"" = runif(100, 0, 100), ""siteno"" = ""X1"") #mean = 50.3
x2 &lt;- data.frame(""V1"" = runif(100, 200, 450), ""siteno"" = ""X2"") #mean = 322.4
x3 &lt;- data.frame(""V1"" = runif(100, 50, 150), ""siteno"" = ""X3"") #mean = 97.8
xData &lt;- rbind(x1,x2,x3)
xData$siteno &lt;- with(xData, reorder(siteno, V1, mean))

zData &lt;- data.frame(""V1"" = runif(300, 0, 450), ""siteno"" = ""Z1"") #mean = 224.2

#orders xData correctly 
ggplot(xData, aes(x = siteno , y = V1)) +
stat_summary(fun.y=mean, colour=""red"", geom=""point"") +
geom_boxplot (aes(fill=siteno), alpha=.5, width=1, position = position_dodge(width = 1),  outlier.colour = ""dark gray"", outlier.size = 1)
</code></pre>

<p>this produces the below plot with x variables correctly ordered by mean:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xB1LQ.jpg"" alt=""correctly ordered boxplots""></p>

<p>If I try the code below to add the control data, the order of the x variables is lost:</p>

<pre><code>x1 &lt;- data.frame(""V1"" = runif(100, 0, 100), ""siteno"" = ""X1"") #mean = 50.3
x2 &lt;- data.frame(""V1"" = runif(100, 200, 450), ""siteno"" = ""X2"") #mean = 322.4
x3 &lt;- data.frame(""V1"" = runif(100, 50, 150), ""siteno"" = ""X3"") #mean = 97.8
xData &lt;- rbind(x1,x2,x3)
xData$siteno &lt;- with(xData, reorder(siteno, V1, mean))

zData &lt;- data.frame(""V1"" = runif(300, 0, 450), ""siteno"" = ""Z1"") #mean = 224.2

#orders xData correctly 
ggplot(xData, aes(x = siteno , y = V1)) +

geom_boxplot(data=zData, aes(x = siteno , y = V1))
</code></pre>

<p>this produces the following plot with no ordering of the x variables:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zlL1w.jpg"" alt=""incorrectly ordered boxplots""> </p>

<p>The point of my graph is to show the test values ordered by their mean and then have the control values boxplot off to the right for visual reference. I imagine there could be a solution that combines the xData and zData dataframes; I am willing to try that if there are some suggestions.
Thank you for your time. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When users request a page, it can take anywhere from 200 to 500ms for the backend server to stitch together the HTML page. During this time, the browser is idle as it waits for the data to arrive. In PHP you have the function flush(). It allows you to send your partially ready HTML response to the browser so that the browser can start fetching components while your backend is busy with the rest of the HTML page. The benefit is mainly seen on busy backends or light frontends. </p>
  
  <p>A good place to consider flushing is right after the HEAD because the HTML for the head is usually easier to produce and it allows you to include any CSS and JavaScript files for the browser to start fetching in parallel while the backend is still processing. </p>
  
  <p>Example:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>... &lt;!-- css, js --&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;?php flush(); ?&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
... &lt;!-- content --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note the point at which the flush occurs here is after the head tag is written.  This makes a lot of sense so the browser can begin loading images and scripts while the remainder of the page is rendered and served.</p>

<p>Is there a way to flush after the head (or any other part of the page) explicitly using ASP.NET?</p>

<p>When i open this URL from my home, it opens some web page. Same url if i open from my office network, i get a entirely differnt URL, which is what i want. </p>

<p>Both, my home and office are in same city in India(3 Km. apart!) but somehow from my home network, i get served a entirely different page which is not what i am trying to open.(The page opening up in the office one is desired one. Office network  has proxy/firewall which could be shielding the IP address for opening to outside world!). </p>

<p>My question is why is it happening so, because both accesses are happening from same country/city(but different ISPs though!), so there cannot be a country/IP specific host/content served differently than the global content of the same server. </p>

<p>So what could be happening here?</p>

<p>This raised another question in my mind(when i tried to find ip of the server using nslookup and domain name which returned error - ""can't find www.jobserve.com/: Non-existent domain""):-
How can i find IP address of the web server using the domain name other than nslookup which is not working for this particular domain/url?</p>

<p>I recall there were some sites which find geographical location of server and show that pictorially, but i am not able to recall the url for that? Does anyone know?</p>

I'd rather not use Flash though, so I though about using .NET.</p>

<p>Now I believe the correct terminology for a native code control that can be downloaded and run in the browser is ""ActiveX control"". So my question is, can I create such an ActiveX control with .NET?</p>

<p>I've found some tutorials on the web, but they all expect you to have the assembly installed on your local machine, and registered and trusted both it and the website that's accessing it.</p>

<p>This is asking a bit much for potential anonymous internet users, and even for intranet users another method of deployment would be preferable.</p>

<p>I distinctly remember some website asking me to download this or that ActiveX control. And on pages requiring such browser plugins as Flash and Java, there is some mechanism by which the browser knows where to fetch the plugin for that media type.</p>

<p>So my question is twofold:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can I create a control that can run in the user's browser in .NET?</li>
<li>What is the best method of (semi-)automatic delivery that I can achieve?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>In response to Sunny:</p>

<p>Yes, a lot of JavaScript rich text editors allow you to paste a <strong>linked image</strong> into a text field, and it will insert the correct &lt;img&gt; tag. However, this only works for images that already have a location on the web, and I want this to upload new images just by copy/pasting any random bitmap from your clipboard.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;UniformGrid Margin=""10""&gt;
    &lt;TabControl&gt;
        &lt;TabItem Header=""First"" Name=""MainRegion"" cal:RegionManager.RegionName=""MainRegion""/&gt;
        &lt;TabItem Header=""Second"" Name=""SecondRegion"" cal:RegionManager.RegionName=""SecondRegion""/&gt;
    &lt;/TabControl&gt;
&lt;/UniformGrid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the bootstrapper two modules are loaded and each injects a view into each of the tabitems:</p>

<pre><code>protected override IModuleCatalog GetModuleCatalog()
{
    ModuleCatalog catalog = new ModuleCatalog();
    catalog.AddModule(typeof(SecondModule.SecondModule));
    catalog.AddModule(typeof(HelloWorldModule.HelloWorldModule));
    return catalog;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, of course, I want to perform the decoupling magic that I keep reading about and uncomment one of the modules and see its tab item not appear at all. Instead, on the contrary, there are still two TabItems and one is empty. This tells me that my application is still tightly coupling data and UI as in the bad old WinForm days.</p>

<p>So what do I need to do here to make this dynamic, so that the UI changes dynamically based on what modules are loaded, i.e. so that I could load 10 modules/views in my bootstrapper and there would automatically be 10 TabItems in the TabControl?</p>

<h2>INTERMEDIATE ANSWER:</h2>

<p>If I just make one region in a TabControl:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TabControl Name=""MainRegion"" cal:RegionManager.RegionName=""MainRegion""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and then load both controls into the MainRegion:</p>

<pre><code>        public void Initialize()
        {
            regionManager.RegisterViewWithRegion(""MainRegion"", typeof(Views.SecondView));
        }
...
        public void Initialize()
        {
            regionManager.RegisterViewWithRegion(""MainRegion"", typeof(Views.HelloWorldView));
        }
</code></pre>

<p>then I get a TabControl with two tabs, each with a view in it, which is what I want.</p>

<p>But the TabItem headers are not defined. How do I dynamically define the header (e.g. not in the XAML but dynamically back in the View classes)?</p>

<p>I'm developing on Vista, IIS7, pretty ok hardware; while the server is a single machine,  running Windows server 2003 and IIS6 on a Xeon &lt;3 ghz and a gigabit line.</p>

<p>Of course, I understand that the web server is especially tailored for this kind of activity,<br>
but it still seems strange that a machine serving up to 2-300 sessions at a time<br>
 (spread unevenly on ~5 .Net 2.0 applications) through a remote network(aka. the internet ;-)<br>
is so much faster at presenting the pages, compared to running the code locally...</p>

<p>Just something that's been on my mind for a while...   </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong><br>
Thanks a lot for the answers! Just thought I'd add a few points to the above:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have tried removing all obstacles surrounding my localhost; turned off the firewall and antivirus, stopped pouring milk into my computer case, killed any heavy processes etc.</li>
<li>This is not contained to just one project or app; it's something I've noticed and wondered about since I started working as a developer ( ~1 year )</li>
<li>Don't think inaccessible resources has any significance; when working locally I usually have all the project's assets(pictures, flash, etc.) locally</li>
<li>Can't really see any difference concering cache on or off.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chose a random page from the project I'm currently working on, reloaded it completly a couple of times; locally I got it in about 4 seconds, compared to ~2 sec from the server.
This was using FF and Firebug; using Opera I kind of felt there was a smaller difference but that's just my gut...</p>

<p>So I guess that leaves (as you mentioned) harddrives and the database connection...
Just seems weird....</p>

<p>If you ever see these lines and are mistified like I was, here's what they mean.</p>

<p><code>Thread[AWT-EventQueue-0] (Suspended (exception NullPointerException))</code></p>

<p><code>EventDispatchTread.run() line: not available [local variables unavailable]</code></p>

<p>It's not that the variables are unavailable because they are lurking behind a shroud of mystery in a library somewhere dank. No no, they just went out of scope! It's still your fault, you still have to find the null, and no you can't blame the library. Important lesson!</p>

<h3>QUESTION:</h3>

<p>One of the most frustrating things for me, as a beginner is libraries! It's a love/hate relationship: On the one hand they let me do things I wouldn't normally understand how to do with the code that I do understand, on the other hand because I don't completely understand them, they sometimes throw a wrench in code that is otherwise working fine! It's because I don't understand the errors that can occur when using these libraries, because I didn't write them, and because eclipse doesn't give me a great deal to go with when one of imports starts acting up...</p>

<p>So here's the problem: I've been working with java.awt.event to handle a bunch of JButtons on the screen for this and that. I get an error when I use one of the buttons I've made. The error is:</p>

<p><code>Thread[AWT-EventQueue-0] (Suspended (exception NullPointerException))</code></p>

<p><code>EventDispatchTread.run() line: not available [local variables unavailable]</code></p>

<p>What does this mean? What could be causing it? I'm embarrassed to post code, but if you can stand to try to decipher my terrible style, here is the method that seems to cause this error to be thrown.</p>

<pre><code>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
    String cmd = e.getActionCommand();
    String name;

code...

if(cmd.equals(""Play"")) {
        name = field.getText();
        card = getCard(name);

        if(card != null) {
            if(rules.zoneHasCard(card, rules.hand)) {
                display.updateStatusMessage(rules.play(card));
                field.setText("""");
                display.updateHand(rules.zoneList(""hand""));
                display.updateDiscard(rules.zoneList(""Discard"")); // This is the error here! The discard Zone was empty!
            }
            else {
                field.setText(""You do not have "" + card.getName());
                field.selectAll();
            }
        }
        else {
            field.setText(""That cardname is unused"");

We have various options to set transparencies of images, different fonts, colors, and just a bunch of stuff to make the cards look pretty. The problem seems to be that not every card printer really functions the same with the same set of parameters. For example, some edge to edge printing really doesn't seem to be edge to edge, while on other printers it seems to go over the edge.</p>

<p>What I think we need is a way to install various card printer drivers, print to them, and have the output go to an image or pdf or something that we can view on screen to see what it looks like when the driver prints to the printer.</p>

<p>However, I am not sure if that would really work or not. I am not a hardware person, so I don't know how the drivers really interact with the printer hardware. </p>

<ul>
<li>All messages are time-stamped and prefixed with a severity level.</li>
<li>Logs are for the customer.  They record the system's responses to his/her requests.</li>
<li>Any log that identifies a problem also suggests a solution.</li>
<li>Debugs are for developers and Tech Support.  They reveal the system internals.</li>
<li>Debugs indicate the function and/or line that generated them.</li>
<li>The customer can adjust the debug level on the fly to set the verbosity.</li>

It appears they're unlikely to pay for it, so our boss would like us to introduce a time bomb.</p>

<p><strong><em>[Edit:] Technical responses only please! Whether this is a good (or legal) idea is a question for CEOoverflow.com</em></strong> ;-)</p>

<p>All pages in the application inherit from a class called ApplicationBasePage and have consistent error handling, so I'm thinking that throwing an exception early in the lifecycle of ApplicationBasePage will be an easy way to make the application unusable. I'm open to other ideas you may have though.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>how and where should we store the date on which the application will expire?</strong></p>

<p>Some points to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>The application is installed on a single server in the customer's offices.</li>
<li>Application data is held in a SQL Server 2005 database held on the same server. The database was designed by us and is not used for anything else.</li>
<li>The application is only accessible on their intranet: there is no access to the application over the Internet.</li>
<li>We currently have remote desktop access to their server, but would expect to lose that if things turn nasty.</li>
<li>The application is written in .NET 2.0.</li>
<li>Security is handled by FormsAuthentication.</li>
<li>We need to be able to turn the timebomb off or change the its trigger date easily (assume we still have remote desktop access to do this).</li>
<li>The server can normally access the Internet, but it would be best not to rely on this.</li>
<li>The timebomb will only lock users out: it won't destroy any data.</li>
<li>Unless it triggers, the customer must never be aware of the time bomb's existence.</li>
<li>Their IT guy will happily go poking around in the web.config or in the database. He's not a programmer but he's not afraid to change things ""just to see what happens"". Decompiling or reverse engineering the application would be beyond his capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>For extra credit, how much do you think it's OK to rely on security through obscurity in this case?</p>

<p>[<strong>Edit:</strong>]</p>

<ul>
<li>The application does a lot of business-critical date-dependent stuff, so we can be sure they won't change the clock on their server as this would make the application worse than useless.</li>

"244772","1","244805","","2008-10-28 20:38:28","","16","5111","<p>I'm creating a series of builders to clean up the syntax which creates domain classes for my mocks as part of improving our overall unit tests.  My builders essentially populate a domain class (such as a <code>Schedule</code>) with some values determined by invoking the appropriate <code>WithXXX</code> and chaining them together.</p>

<p>I've encountered some commonality amongst my builders and I want to abstract that away into a base class to increase code reuse.  Unfortunately what I end up with looks like:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class BaseBuilder&lt;T,BLDR&gt; where BLDR : BaseBuilder&lt;T,BLDR&gt; 
                                          where T : new()
{
    public abstract T Build();

    protected int Id { get; private set; }
    protected abstract BLDR This { get; }

    public BLDR WithId(int id)
    {
        Id = id;
        return This;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Take special note of the <code>protected abstract BLDR This { get; }</code>.</p>

<p>A sample implementation of a domain class builder is:</p>

<pre><code>public class ScheduleIntervalBuilder :
    BaseBuilder&lt;ScheduleInterval,ScheduleIntervalBuilder&gt;
{
    private int _scheduleId;
    // ...

    // UG! here's the problem:
    protected override ScheduleIntervalBuilder This
    {
        get { return this; }
    }

    public override ScheduleInterval Build()
    {
        return new ScheduleInterval
        {
            Id = base.Id,
            ScheduleId = _scheduleId
                    // ...
        };
    }

    public ScheduleIntervalBuilder WithScheduleId(int scheduleId)
    {
        _scheduleId = scheduleId;
        return this;
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Because BLDR is not of type BaseBuilder I cannot use <code>return this</code> in the <code>WithId(int)</code> method of <code>BaseBuilder</code>.</p>

<p>Is exposing the child type with the property <code>abstract BLDR This { get; }</code> my only option here, or am I missing some syntax trick?</p>

<p>Update (since I can show why I'm doing this a bit more clearly):</p>

<p>The end result is to have builders that build profiled domain classes that one would expect to retrieve from the database in a [programmer] readable format.  There's nothing wrong with...</p>

<pre><code>mock.Expect(m =&gt; m.Select(It.IsAny&lt;int&gt;())).Returns(
    new Schedule
    {
        ScheduleId = 1
        // ...
    }
);
</code></pre>

<p>as that's pretty readable already.  The alternative builder syntax is:</p>

<pre><code>mock.Expect(m =&gt; m.Select(It.IsAny&lt;int&gt;())).Returns(
    new ScheduleBuilder()
        .WithId(1)
        // ...
        .Build()
);
</code></pre>

<p>the advantage I'm looking for out of using builders (and implementing all these <code>WithXXX</code> methods) is to abstract away complex property creation (automatically expand our database lookup values with the correct <code>Lookup.KnownValues</code> without hitting the database obviously) and having the builder provide commonly reusable test profiles for domain classes...</p>

<pre><code>mock.Expect(m =&gt; m.Select(It.IsAny&lt;int&gt;())).Returns(
    new ScheduleBuilder()
        .AsOneDay()
        .Build()
);

I've been told that the following issues with this setup currently exist: </p>

<ol>
<li>When using an UNC path as home directory, there is an ""index"" somewhere in IIS which ""caches"" up to a certain amount of files of certain types, and when the limit, which defaults to 50, has been reached, subsequent requests to pages not in the cache will return 404.</li>
<li>When using an UNC path as home directory, when starting the IIS site, the aforementioned ""cache"" will start filling, which will bog down the site IIS until the cache is filled, meaning that huge sites (15,000 .asp files) are unavailable for up to 30 minutes after the IIS site starts. </li>
<li>When using an UNC path as home directory, if more than a certain number of simultaneous requests are made to the site, Windows will reach the ""Network BIOS command limit per server"", and all requests above the limit will have to wait until IIS ""closes the session"" to the server. I am told the limit is 100 files and not configurable. </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, all this sounds a bit weird. If I set up a new Windows 2003 server with default settings, and use it to host an ASP Classic application with 15,000 .asp files, using a share on a server as the home directory for the IIS site, <strong>will I actually run into these problems? And if so, is there a way to counter them without changing the architecture?</strong></p>

<p>(To clarify, the only reason the ""load balancing"" is important is that load balancing is the reason the files are on a share on a server. If no load balancing was needed, the files could be on the local disk.) </p>

A Curried application of E is either an application of E or an application of a Curried application of E.""</p>

<p>Can anyone help with a more lucid explanation of what's being asked for here?</p>

<p>Actually even giving me the answer to this problem would be helpful, since there are five more to solve after this one. ... I just am not getting the basic idea.</p>

<p>Addition: Even after Brian Campbell's lengthy explanation, I'm still somewhat lost.</p>

<p>Is <code>(foo1 (sqrt 3)))</code> considered an application of foo, and therefore a curried application of foo?</p>

<p>Seems too simple, but maybe...</p>

<p>Typing <code>(((foo1 2 )) 2)</code> into DrScheme gives the following error (which I kind of expected) </p>

<p>After re-reading <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36314/what-is-currying"">What is Currying?</a> I understand I can also re-define foo1 to be:</p>

<pre><code>(define (foo1 a)

<p>So then I can type </p>

<p>But this doesn't really get me any closer to producing 3 as an output, and it seems like this isn't really currying the original foo1, it's just re-defining it.</p>

<p>At the moment, we are using BCL Technologies easyPDF with Microsoft Office installed onto the Server. This handles most documents but we haven't had it doing Open Office ones yet.</p>

<p>We currently produce around 100-1000 of these PDF's per day.</p>

<p>The reason I am asking the question is that performance is a key issue. The PDF is generated for users on the fly and so the waiting times we are currently getting of 30-60 seconds is becoming unacceptable.</p>

<p>We have done some caching around documents when they are intially uploaded so the main tasks that happens when a User requests a Pdf is merging a number of already generated Pdf's.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:
I decided to seperate each layer into a project and ran into a circular dependency problem in the DAL layer when trying to add a reference to the BLL.

<p>My issue is this, I am refactoring some existing javascript code and using jQuery to do it. In several places I've come across javascript code similar to the following:</p>

<pre><code>// some js code working with the customAttribute value
javascriptElementObject.customAttribue = void(0);
</code></pre>

<p>The javascriptElementObject is now a jQuery object and I have been attempting to use the following code to do the same thing:</p>

<pre><code>// some js code working with the customAttribute value
javascriptElementObject.attr(""customAttribute"", void(0));
</code></pre>

<p>However, this does not seem to be doing anything. The following code works however:</p>

<pre><code>javascriptElementObject.get(0).customAttribute = void(0);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm aware of jQuery's removeAttr() function, but have not used it so far because I don't know if it's equivalent to setting the attribute value to void(0).</p>

<p>So I guess that really means I have 2 questions: </p>

<ol>
<li>Why doesn't the first jQuery version work? </li>
<li>Are .get(0).customAttribue = void(0); and .removeAttr(""customAttribute); equivalent?</li>

<p>The previous build, which was PDE-based, resulted in a separate headless application which parses through all plugins in the context, looks inside them for test classes, tosses all test cases into a larger suite, and then runs it programmatically, via <code>JUnitResultFormatter.startTestSuite()</code>. In the process it adds some homegrown tests for particular metadata (copyright markings, etc) and tests for package dependency.</p>

"693881","1","","","2009-03-29 00:41:36","","0","5122","<p>I'm making a simple forum, and in the listing of the threads i want the classical ""last post by (user) at (date)"" to show. I'm using only one table to contain all the posts in the forum, where posts with the parentPost-field not equal to null are replies to a thread.</p>

<p>These are the tables and necessary fields i need data from:</p>

forumPosts

<ul>
<li><strong>id</strong>: integer, primary key</li>
<li><strong>title</strong>: string value</li>
<li><strong>date</strong>: string value</li>
<li><strong>parentPost</strong>: integer (This field = ID of the initial post in the thread. If it's NULL, the post is an ""initial thread post"")</li>
<li><strong>author</strong>: integer, foreign key to the users table</li>
<li><strong>countAnswers</strong>: integer</li>
<li><strong>lastPost</strong>: integer, (This field = the ID of the last post which was replied to it. Only used when the parentPost-field = NULL)</li>
</ul>

users

<ul>
<li><strong>userid</strong>: integer, primary key</li>
<li><strong>firstName</strong>: string value</li>
<li><strong>lastName</strong>: string value</li>
</ul>

<p>As of now, i have this query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT forumPosts.id, forumPosts.title, forumPosts.date, forumPosts.author, forumPosts.countAnswers, users.firstName, users.lastName 
FROM forumPosts 
INNER JOIN users ON forumPosts.author = users.userid 
WHERE forumPosts.parentPost IS NULL ORDER BY id DESC;
</code></pre>

<p>Returns all I need (ID, Title, Date, Author and how many replies it has), except for the date and author of the last posted reply.</p>

<p>In addition, I'd like to fetch the following:</p>

<p>The date from the last post in the thread, that is the post with the highest ID <em>and</em> parentPost = forumPosts.id. I'd also want to fetch the firstName and lastName from the user that posted this reply.</p>

<p>I've been fooling around now for a long time with different joins and derived tables and such, but I can't seem to get this right. Ideally, i'd want a table returned with the following fields:</p>

<ul>
<li>id</li>
<li>title</li>
<li>date</li>
<li>firstName</li>
<li>lastName</li>
<li>countAnswers</li>
<li>lastReplyDate</li>
<li>lastReplyFirstName</li>
<li>lastReplyLastName</li>
</ul>

<p>To me, it seems possible, but I obviously can't make it.</p>

<p>I hope you understood my somewhat complex question, and i thank you a lot for all answers.</p>

<h3>The sollution</h3>

<pre><code>SELECT        forumPosts.id, forumPosts.title, forumPosts.date, forumPosts.author, forumPosts.countAnswers, users.firstName, users.lastName, 
                     lastPost.date AS lastPostDate, lastUser.firstName AS lastPostFirstName, lastUser.lastName AS lastPostLastName
FROM            forumPosts AS lastPost INNER JOIN
                     users AS lastUser ON lastPost.author = lastUser.userid INNER JOIN
                     forumPosts INNER JOIN
                     users ON forumPosts.author = users.userid ON lastPost.id = forumPosts.lastPost

We have 2 servers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deployment server</li>
<li>File Server</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is that the deployment server doesn't have much space. And we keep 10 days backups of our databases. Therefore we need to store our backups on an external ""file server"". The problem is that SQL doesn't permit this.
I've tried to run the SQL 2008 service with an account that has admin rights on both pc's (domain account), but this still doesn't work.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on this one.
Otherwise we'll have to put an external harddisk on a rack server and that's kinda silly no?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I've found a way to make it work.
You have to share the folder on the server. Then grant the Development Server (the PC itself) write permissions. This will make external backups possible with SQL server.
Don't know if it's safe though, I find it kinda strange to give a computer rights on a folder.</p>

<p>I just wonder, is there a way to check every project (heck, every .cs file) in my whole Visual Studio solution and get a list of all referenced Assemblies and Namespaces that are not actually being used and can be safely removed? I know that ReSharper can do it for a single Code File, but I did not see an option to check all files or to check for unneeded Assemblies.</p>

<p>Using Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 Professional if that matters.</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks so far. The Problem with ReSharper or ""Remove and Readd if build breaks"" is that it's quite tedious on every single file and assembly (My project has about 120 .cs Files in 7 Assemblies, and references a total of 18 Assemblies outside of the solution), so ideally i'm looking for something ""one-click"".

<p>Have you guys got any thoughts on how I would move all of the logic from my code-layer to pure SQL, or at least how I can optimize the performance of what I'm doing?</p>

<p>I am thinking along the lines of temporary tables:</p>

<p><strong>Step one</strong>: <code>SELECT IngredientsID FROM Ingredients</code> and <code>INSERT INTO temp-table</code></p>

<p><strong>Step two</strong>: <code>SELECT RecipesName FROM Recipes</code> joined with <code>IngredientsRecipes</code> joined with <code>temp-table.IngredientsID</code></p>

Whilst I will state that handling exceptions from an application-wide point of view isn't something we want, typically it's unavoidable when our team are understaffed for the sheer amount of work we need to push out the door, so please, no flaming the globalised solution to exception handling here :)</p>

<p>I've had a good hunt to see what common solutions exist.  At the moment we use Global.asax with the Application_Error event to do Server.GetLastError() which is placed in Session state then a redirect is called to another page where the session data is then retrieved and output in a human readable format.  The redirect also calls a sproc which will carefully audit the error information which is a) e-mailed to the developers and b) viewed from a web page only viewable by developers.</p>

<p>The new way I've seen of doing things is using the IHttpModule interface using a class in App_Code to do something along these lines (this is my quick implementation)</p>

<pre><code>Imports Microsoft.VisualBasic

Public Class ErrorModule : Implements IHttpModule

  Public Sub Dispose() Implements System.Web.IHttpModule.Dispose
    ' Not used
  End Sub

  Public Sub Init(ByVal context As System.Web.HttpApplication) Implements System.Web.IHttpModule.Init
    AddHandler context.Error, AddressOf context_Error
  End Sub

  Public Sub context_Error(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Dim ex As Exception = HttpContext.Current.Server.GetLastError

    ' do something with the error
    ' call the stored procedure
    ' redirect the user to the error page

    HttpContext.Current.Server.ClearError()
    HttpContext.Current.Response.Redirect(""index.htm"")

  End Sub
End Class
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, what is the benefit of this solution over using Global.asax events?  Additionally, what is the best way to hand the data to an error page?</p>

<p><em>EDIT:</em> The code above does work by the way ;)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Also, how does the HttpModule work behind the scenes?  Does it just register the Error event to that particular function on application start?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Upon much further investigation it seems grabbing session data is really, really messy when it comes to using IHttpModule interface.  I don't think MS have matured HttpModule enough for it to be used in our particular scenario - until there are events specific to session data it's too dangerous for us to use.</p>

<p>This never happens with web applications because web page requests (and even better Ajax requests) represent the perfect short lived transaction so a session can be opened and closed to handle each request.</p>

<p>However if I load an tree of objects in my forms application and put then into a navigation pane on the screen they may stay their for the life of the application - and at any point the user may click on them, resulting in our code needing to navigate the object relationships to other objects (which only works within an NHibernate session).</p>

Break as soon as an exception is thrown, and breaking only when an exception isn't caught. This works fine when developing desktop applications. However, when developing ASP.NET applications, all exceptions are eventually caught by the code in IIS.  Is it possible to disable this behavior, so that the debugger breaks when my ASP.Net application code fails to catch an exception?  </p>

<h3>Edit:</h3>

<p>Just to be clear, I don't want to break whenever an exception is thrown, as many times they are handled just fine by my code, and I don't want to stop on every exception. I only want to stop on the exceptions that aren't handled by my code.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Edit:</h3>

<p>This seems to not be an issue in Visual Studio 2008. In Visual Studio 2003, all exceptions were treated as user handled, because the ASP.NET runtime caught all the exceptions so as not to bring down the web server process. It seems that in Visual Studio 2008, this type of exception catching is not counted when checking for user-unhandled exceptions.</p>

<p>Global-auto-revert mode would have been a perfectly fine solution, and I wish I could choose two answers.  I prefer revbuffs simply because of a, possibly irrational, feeling of wanting to be in control of what happens.</p>

<p>I'd kind of guessed that if I accessed git from within emacs, then it could probably be handled easier, but I currently prefer accessing git through the commandline.

I'm trying (for now) to write a very simple server program that accepts a socket connection and starts a new thread to process it. It seems to work fine except that it will only create about 300 threads (303, sometimes 304) before pthread_create() fails with the EAGAIN code, which means:</p>

<p>""The  system  lacked  the  necessary  resources to create another thread, or the system-imposed  limit  on  the  total  number  of threads in a process {PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX} would be exceeded.""</p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> 303 threads at the same time - each thread exits which is confirmed by gdb. Each time the process request function is called there are two threads running.</p>

<p>So it means ""the system lacked the necessary resources"". My question is (and it may be a bit stupid) - what are these resources? Presumably it's a memory leak in my program (certainly possible, likely even), but I'd have thought that even so it could manage more than 300 considering the rest of the program does very little.</p>

<p>How can I find out how much memory my program has available to confirm that it's running out of it? There's plenty of memory and swap free so presumably there's an artificial limit imposed by the OS (Linux).</p>

Just for background, I am having to move the app into MVC because my boss is making me. Anyway, I've sat down, and printed out the directory structure. I've then started trying to plan how I can convert these pages into controller/action pairs. Some things seem very straight forward. For example, I had a couple pages devoted to add/edit/delete of a user. That's very easy to create a ""user"" controller, and add methods or actions for add/edit/delete. Where I am having problems is deciding when to actually create a controller versus making something just an action as it's not always so clear cut. For example, a login controller versus user/login, or a register controller versus user/register. To me, if the object can do something it makes perfect sense to be an action, but it's just not always so clear cut.</p>

<p>Another example would be, that I have about 12 form pages that are used to create a ""plan"". In my head I would think I needed to create a ""plan"" controller, and each one of the old for pages would then become an action. So I'd have one controller with 12 actions (methods). The problem for me is, that although all 12 of these pages are data entry forms that eventually make up this ""plan"" that's all they have in common. Each of the pages use different tables in the database, and have nothing else in common with each other. Basically by creating a ""plan"" controller I'm just really using that as a grouping mechanism; not necessarily using it because they have something related with each other. At least in the ""user"" controller example above; each one of those actions uses the same ""user"" table, so it makes sense to group those actions into one controller. Should I make each one of those data entry forms there own controller?</p>

<p>I guess it just boils down to letting myself use controllers as a hierarchy structure entity instead of objects/actions. It just seems it's really easy to fall into that trap using controllers the wrong way. Does anyone understand what I'm saying? Hopefully it's not too confusing.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: If I try and stick with one controller per view; I will then be keeping code per request to a minimum. Is this the best way?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: From what everyone is saying, it seems that the one controller per view would not be in my best interest. I still have some concerns because it seems that a controller could become fat in a hurry, but that's for another discussion. I also still have some issues of when to make that decision to use a controller instead of an action. A good example would be stack<strong>overflow</strong> itself.  At the top of the page, you have a ""Questions"" selection which we could assume takes you to the ""questions"" controller. I say this because on the right hand side you can choose to ""Ask a question"", which the URL points to ""questions/ask"". That makes sense that your using the ask method of the questions controller. What confuses me is then you have the ""Unanswered"" option on the menu. It looks like this has a controller to itself. Why wouldn't it just be an action under the questions controller as in ""questions/unanswered""? That's where things become muddy for me.</p>

<p>This is intended to get the row of the item I pass in. Under certain circumstances (although I can't pin down exactly when), odd things happen to the call to the Match function.</p>

<p>i.e. the lookup works, and lMyRow gets a value assigned to it. If I let that statement execute in the actual code, I lMyRow gets a value of 0.</p>

<p>This seems very odd! I don't understand how executing something in the immediate window can succeed in assigning a value, where the same call, at the same point in program execution can give a value of 0 when it runs normally in code!</p>

<p>The example was taken from this book and its package <code>ChemometricsWithR</code>. It highlighted some pitfalls when modeling using cross-validation techniques.  </p>

<p><strong>The Aim:</strong><br>
A cross-validated methodology using the same set of repeated CV to perform a known strategy of <code>PLS</code> followed typically by <code>LDA</code> or cousins like logistic regression, SVM, C5.0, CART, with the spirit of <code>caret</code> package. So PLS would be needed every time before calling the waiting classifier in order to classify PLS <em>score</em> space instead of the observations themselves. The nearest approach in the caret package is doing <code>PCA</code> as a pre-processing step before modeling with any classifier. Below is a PLS-LDA procedure with only one cross-validation to test performance of the classifier, there was no 10-fold CV or any repetition. The code below was taken from the mentioned book but with some corrections otherwise throws error:   </p>

<pre><code>library(ChemometricsWithR)
data(prostate)
prostate.clmat &lt;- classvec2classmat(prostate.type) # convert Y to a dummy var

odd &lt;- seq(1, length(prostate.type), by = 2) # training

prostate.pls &lt;- plsr(prostate.clmat ~ prostate, ncomp = 16, validation = ""CV"", subset=odd)

Xtst &lt;- scale(prostate[even,], center = colMeans(prostate[odd,]), scale = apply(prostate[odd,],2,sd))

tst.scores &lt;- Xtst %*% prostate.pls$projection # scores for the waiting trained LDA to test

prostate.ldapls &lt;- lda(scores(prostate.pls)[,1:16],prostate.type[odd]) # LDA for scores
table(predict(prostate.ldapls, new = tst.scores[,1:16])$class, prostate.type[even])

<p>However, the confusion matrix didn't match that in the book, anyway the code in the book did break, but this one here worked with me!</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong><br>
Although this was only one CV, but the intention is to agree on this methodology first, <code>sd</code> and <code>mean</code> of the train set were applied on the test set, PLUS transformed into PLS scores based a specific number of PC <code>ncomp</code>. I want this to occur every round of the CV in the caret. If the methodology as code is correct here, then it can serve, may be, as a good start for a minimal work example while modifying the code of the caret package.</p>

<p><strong>Side Notes:</strong><br>
It can be very messy with scaling and centering, I think some of the PLS functions in R do scaling internally, with or without centering, I am not sure, so building a custom model in caret should be handled with care to avoid both lack or multiple scalings or centerings (I am on my guards with these things).  </p>

<p><strong>Perils of multiple centering/scaling</strong><br>
The code below is just to show how multliple centering/scaling can change the data, only centering is shown here but the same problem with scaling applies too.  </p>

<pre><code>set.seed(1)
x &lt;- rnorm(200, 2, 1)
xCentered1 &lt;- scale(x, center=TRUE, scale=FALSE)
xCentered2 &lt;- scale(xCentered1, center=TRUE, scale=FALSE)
xCentered3 &lt;- scale(xCentered2, center=TRUE, scale=FALSE)
sapply (list(xNotCentered= x, xCentered1 = xCentered1, xCentered2 = xCentered2, xCentered3 = xCentered3), mean)

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++)

<p>Edit</p>

<p>I really do not want to use transactions for most of this, as it is just for reporting purposes.  So an example of what I am doing is:</p>

  UPDATE #table SET currWorker = tblUser.UserLogonName

<p>So if one row does not update correctly I do not want to loose the whole thing.  But it would be very handy to know the value of #table.loanid that caused the problem.  </p>

Things like System.IndexOutOfRangeException on a SqlDataReader object for an index that should be returned and has been returning for a while now.</p>

<p>Anyways, I looked at the Task Manager and saw that sqlservr.exe was running at around 1,500,000 K Mem Usage. I am by no means a DBA, but that large usage of memory looked wrong to me on a Win Server 2003 R2 Enterprise with Intel Xeon 3.33Ghz with 4GB ram. So I restarted the  SQL Server instance. After the restart, everything went back to normal. Errors suddenly stopped occurring. <strong>So does this large main memory usage eventually cause errors?</strong></p>

<p>Additionally, I did a quick Google for <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=high+memory+usage+mssql"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">high memory usage mssql</a>. I found that if left to default settings;  SQL Server can grow to be that large. Also, found a link to MS about <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;321363"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How to adjust memory usage by using configuration options in SQL Server</a>.</p>

<p>Question now is...<strong>how much main memory should SQL Server should be limited to?</strong></p>

<p>Edit:  There are tons of codes - it's possible that every code is different.</p>

<p>EPILOGUE:  I've selected Darius Bacon as best answer, because I think the best algorithm is a modification of the majority element he linked to.  The majority algorithm should be modifiable to only use a tiny amount of memory - like 201 codes to get 1/2% I think.  Basically you just walk the stream counting up to 201 distinct codes.  As soon as you find 201 distinct codes, you drop one of each code (deduct 1 from the counters, forgetting anything that becomes 0).  At the end, you have dropped at most N/201 times, so any code occurring more times than that must still be around.</p>

<p>But it's a two pass algorithm, not one.  You need a second pass to tally the counts of the candidates.  It's actually easy to see that any solution to this problem must use at least 2 passes (the first batch of elements you load could all be different and one of those codes could end up being exactly 1/2%)</p>

<p>Does anybody know how I can do this? I could write a loop that waits until the dialog has set a flag and then reads the result to return it, but there must be something that is way more elegant and reusable for waiting of the completion of other asynchronous calls.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Unfortunately a callback does not work as the JavaScript function that calls onApplicationUnload() itself has to return a value (similar to the onApplicationUnload() function in Flex). This JavaScript function has a fixed signature as it is called by a framework and I cannot change it. Or in other words: The call from JavaScript to Flex must also be synchronous.</p>

I can open multiple (but different) instances of the same type of child window.  (Example: I can open 3 instances of child window type A and 2 instances of child window type B.  All 5 windows are distinct entities and do not share data until unless the user explicitly drags the same data onto multiple windows.)  Each child window has a ToolStripContainer with one or more ToolStrips.  How do I prevent:</p>

<ol>
<li>the user from dragging a ToolStrip from a child window of type A to a ToolStripContainer in a child window of type B?</li>
<li>the user from dragging a ToolStrip from one instance of child window A to a ToolStripContainer in another instances of the same type of window?</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm trying to prevent the user from dragging a ToolStrip from instance 1 of type A to instance 2 of type A, selecting some stuff on instance 2, and then clicking a button on the toolbar only to have something weird happen to some other window.  Similarly it doesn't make sense to drag a ToolStrip from a window of type A to a window of type B -- the actions don't apply to that type, but to the user it looks like everything is fine because I let them do the drag.</p>

<p>Is it as simple as adding my own handler for the ControlAdded event or is there a better way to do this?  I'm using WinForms in .NET 3.0.</p>

<p>edit: Steps to reproduce</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new Windows Application project.</li>
<li>Add a new user control.  Give the control a ToolStripContainer that contains one ToolStrip with a single button.</li>
<li>Repeat step 2, giving you a UserControl2 class.</li>
<li>Compile the solution so UserControl1 and UserControl2 show up in your toolbox.</li>
<li>Drag UserControl1 and UserControl2 onto the form.  Set the borders so you know where the boundaries are.</li>
<li>Run the app.</li>
<li>It's now possible to drag the ToolStrip from the container in UserControl1 and drop it into the container in UserControl2 (leaving zero ToolStrips in UC1 and two ToolStrips in UC2.)</li>
<li>Now imagine you only have access to the code in UserControl1.  How do you prevent the user from dragging the ToolStrip out of that instance of the ToolStripContainer?</li>

<p>Basically, I was looking for a way to do constant updates to a web page from a long process. I thought AJAX was the way to go, but Dave has <a href=""http://encosia.com/2007/10/03/easy-incremental-status-updates-for-long-requests/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a nice article about using JavaScript</a>. I integrated it into my application and it worked great on my client, but NOT my server WebHost4Life. I have another server @ Brinkster and decided to try it there and it DOES work. All the code is the same on my client, WebHost4Life, and Brinkster, so there's obviously something going on with WebHost4Life.</p>

<p>I'm planning to write an email to them or request technical support, but I'd like to be proactive and try to figure out what could be going on with their end to cause this difference. I did everything I could with my code to turn off Buffering like <code>Page.Response.BufferOutput = False</code>. What server settings could they have implemented to cause this difference? Is there any way I could circumvent it on my own without their help? If not, what would they need to do?</p>

<p>For reference, a link to the working version of a simpler version of my application is located @ <a href=""http://www.jasoncomedy.com/javascriptfun/javascriptfun.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.jasoncomedy.com/javascriptfun/javascriptfun.aspx</a> and the same version that isn't working is located @ <a href=""http://www.tabroom.org/Ajaxfun/Default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.tabroom.org/Ajaxfun/Default.aspx</a>. You'll notice in the working version, you get updates with each step, but in the one that doesn't, it sits there for a long time until everything is done and then does all the updates to the client at once ... and that makes me sad.</p>

I am using the Visual Studio 2005 Bootstrapper for this task.
To this end, I did the following:
Located the folder C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\SDK\v2.0\BootStrapper\Packages\ and created a folder for my prerequisite (made it same structure as 'dotnetfx'); created the 'product.xml' and 'package.xml' and placed them appropriately. I kept the xml files very simple so far to test the installation:</p>

<p>product.xml</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;

  &lt;/PackageFiles&gt;
  &lt;InstallChecks&gt;
  &lt;/InstallChecks&gt;
  &lt;Commands Reboot=""None""&gt;
    &lt;Command PackageFile=""MyPrereq.exe"" EstimatedInstallSeconds=""90""&gt;
      &lt;InstallConditions&gt;
      &lt;/InstallConditions&gt;
      &lt;ExitCodes&gt;
    &lt;ExitCode Value=""0"" Result=""Success""/&gt;
        &lt;DefaultExitCode Result=""Fail"" String=""GeneralFailure"" FormatMessageFromSystem=""true"" /&gt;
      &lt;/ExitCodes&gt;
    &lt;/Command&gt;
  &lt;/Commands&gt;
&lt;/Product&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>package.xml</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;Package Name=""MyPrereq"" Culture=""Culture"" xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/2004/01/bootstrapper""&gt;
  &lt;Strings&gt;
    &lt;String Name=""Culture""&gt;en&lt;/String&gt;
    &lt;String Name=""DisplayName""&gt;MyPrereq&lt;/String&gt;
    &lt;String Name=""GeneralFailure""&gt;A fatal error occurred. The installation failed.&lt;/String&gt;
  &lt;/Strings&gt;
&lt;/Package&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can add the prerequisite from the list and build my setup project.</p>

<p>The problem:</p>

<p>The build output is the 'setup.exe', the 'MyApp.msi' package, plus the subfolder called 'MyPrereq' which contains 'MyPrereq.exe'.</p>

<p>I would like the build to create a 'setup.exe' and a single 'MyApp.msi', which would contain the 'MyPrereq' inside, with no additional files/directories.</p>

<p>I know that the .NET framework is another prereq for my app, and it is included in the same .msi, so that should be possible somehow.</p>

<p>How can I achieve this? </p>

<p>But the award for Accepted Answer has to go to Paolo Bergantino for the mechanism of adding a class name to mark the dragged element, which saved me some more work!</p>

<hr />

<p>In my HTML I have a table with an image link on each row.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table class=""search_results""&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td class=""thumbnail""&gt;&lt;a href=""...""&gt;&lt;img src=""..."" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>An included javascript file contains the code to make the images draggable</p>

<pre><code>$$( "".thumbnail a img"" ).each(
  function( img )
  {
    new Draggable( img, {revert:true} );
  }
);
</code></pre>

<p>and a simple handler to detect the end of the drag</p>

<pre><code>Draggables.addObserver({
  onEnd:function( eventName, draggable, event )
  {
    // alert ( eventName ); // leaving this in stops IE from following the link
    event.preventDefault(); // Does Not Work !!!
    // event.stop(); // Does Not Work either !!!
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>My idea is that when the image is clicked the link should be followed but when it is dragged something else should happen.</p>

<p>In fact what happens is that when the image is dragged the handler is called but the link is still followed.</p>

<p>I guess that I'm cancelling the wrong event.</p>

<p>How can I prevent the link from being followed after the element is dragged?</p>

<hr />

<p>edit: added event.stop after trying greystate's suggestion</p>

<p>I now have a basic solution that works for FireFox, Apache, etc. See my own answer below.</p>

<p>But I am still looking for a solution for IE7 (and hopefully IE6).</p>

<p>Another problem when dragging images in IE is that the image becomes detached from the mouse pointer when the tool tip appears, you have to release the mouse and click again on the image to re-acquire the drag. So I'm also looking for any ideas that might help resolve that problem.</p>

It claims to be ""the last binary standard"".</p>

<p>It is a standard to store XML data optimized for
processing and storage, is bundled with XML schema (making the data
strongly typed and strongly structured). Well, there are a lot of
claimed advantages. I was impressed most by the processing and
memory-efficiency measurements.</p>

<p>I am asking myself, what is going to happen to all the established
XML APIs?</p>

<p>There is this paragraph related to my question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4.2 Existing XML Processing APIs</p>
  
  <p>As EXI is an encoding of the XML Infoset, an EXI implementation can support any of the commonly-used XML APIs for XML processing, so EXI has no immediate impact on existing XML APIs. However, using an existing XML API also requires that all names and text appearing in the EXI document be converted into strings. In the future, more efficiency might be achievable if the higher layers could directly use these data as typed values appearing in the EXI document. For instance, if a higher layer needs typed data, going through its string form can produce a performance penalty, so an extended API that supports typed data directly could improve performance when used with EXI. </p>
  
  <p>from: <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/exi-impacts/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.w3.org/TR/exi-impacts/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand it as following: <i>""Using EXI with existing APIs?
No performance gain! (Unless you rewrite them all)""</i></p>

<p>Let's take the Java ecosystem as an example:</p>

<p>We have plenty of XML APIs in latest JDK 6
(With each major JDK release, more and more of them were added.)
As far as I can judge, most (if not all) of them are using either
in-memory DOM trees, or serialized (""textual"") representation
to transform/process/validate/... XML data.</p>

<p>What do you guys think, what is going to happen to these
APIs with introduction of EXI?</p>

<p>Thank you all for your opinions.</p>

implementations provide refcounted, copy-on-write strings, allowing you passing
string by value as a primitive type. Also these implementations (at least g++) use
atomic operations making these string lock-free and thread safe.</p>

<p>Easy test shows copy-on-write semantics:</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>I know that there was a bug in VC++6.0 that had non-thread-safe implementation of
reference counting that caused random program craches. Is this the reason? They just
afraid to use ref-counting any more even it is common practice? They prefer to not
use ref-counting at all over fixing the issue?</p>

Another was when we realized, in the same class, that it would be impossible to determine whether a division would ever occur by zero, in the type-checking stage, because checking whether a number, at run-time, is zero, is also a version of the halting problem.</p>

<p>It's purpose is to lookup an article in a list by its Id, and return that article.</p>

<p>However, I'd like to fill the Articles property by databinding a collection to it, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;local:LookupArticleConverter Articles=""{Binding Articles}"" x:Key=""LookupArticle""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this doesn't seem to work. The setter method is never called. The source property contains an actual nonempty collection, so that's not the problem.</p>

<p>There's no error messages regarding binding in the output log, neither.</p>

<p>Any clues? </p>

<p>I have to insert a couple million rows in either SQL Server 2000/2005, MySQL, or Access.  Unfortunately I don't have an easy way to use bulk insert or BCP or any of the other ways that a normal human would go about this.  The inserts will happen on one particular database but that code needs to be db agnostic -- so I can't do bulk copy, or SELECT INTO, or BCP.  I can however run specific queries before and after the inserts, depending on which database I'm importing to.</p>

<p>eg.</p>

<pre><code>If IsSqlServer() Then
    DisableTransactionLogging();
ElseIf IsMySQL() Then
    DisableMySQLIndices();
End If

... do inserts ...

If IsSqlServer() Then
    EnableTransactionLogging();
ElseIf IsMySQL() Then
    EnableMySQLIndices();
End If
</code></pre>

<p><strong>QUESTION</strong></p>

<p>Are there any interesting things I can do to SQL Server that might speed up these inserts?</p>

<p>For example, is there a command I could issue to tell SQL Server, ""Hey, don't bother recording these transactions in the transaction log"".</p>

<p>Or maybe I could say, ""Hey, I have a million rows coming in, so don't update your index until I'm totally finished"".</p>

<pre><code>ALTER INDEX [IX_TableIndex] ON Table DISABLE
     ... inserts
ALTER INDEX [IX_TableIndex] ON Table REBUILD
</code></pre>

<p>(Note: Above index disable only works on 2005, not 2000.  Bonus points if you know a way to do this on 2000).</p>

<p>What about MySQL, and Access?</p>

<p>A new functionality will require me to accept files through this webservice. Basically I'm allowing users to upload files to a file archive through the API, which they'd otherwise do by logging into our browser based administration system.</p>

<p>The API needs to be as easily consumed as possible. I'm thinking of dropping SOAP support since our PHP clients mainly use the GET/POST methods, and the .NET clients don't mind either way. With that as a prerequisite, I'm thinking of simply creating an UploadFile(fileName) method, and the requiring the user to send the file through POST as a normal file upload.</p>

<p>However, I will not be able to specify the file field as a parameter to the method, right? So if I simply state in the documentation ""file should be sent in POST field called 'File'"", would that pose any problems when I need to read the file?</p>

<p>All files are in binary format, PDF's, various image formats, FLV and so forth. Also, file sizes will mainly be in the 2-20MB vicinity, but given the above solution, would I have any troubles accepting files in the 250MB area?</p>

<p>Receiving a file this way would result in the file being loaded completely into memory, before I write it to disk - is there any way around this, besides letting the service receive a Stream and thus disabling me from accepting other parameters, and hindering the easy usage of the service?</p>

<hr>

<p>Besides what's possible on my side, I'm also curious in regards to how I make it as easy as possible for the callees to send the file. I'm guessing POST is one of the most accessible ways of receiving the file, but if anyone has any comments, I'd like to hear them as well.</p>

    waveOutPrepareHeader(hWaveOut, &amp;header, sizeof(WAVEHDR));
    waveOutWrite(hWaveOut, hdr, sizeof(WAVEHDR));
    return 0;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Before anyone comments on this, yes - the sample code plays back uninitialized memory. Don't try this with your speakers turned all the way up.</p>

<p>Some debugging revealed the following information: waveOutPrepareHeader() populates header.reserved with a pointer to what appears to be a structure containing at least two pointers as its first two members. The first pointer is set to NULL. After calling waveOutWrite(), this pointer is set to a pointer allocated on the global heap. In pseudo code, that would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>struct Undocumented { void *p1, *p2; } /* This might have more members */

MMRESULT waveOutPrepareHeader( handle, LPWAVEHDR hdr, ...) {
    hdr-&gt;reserved = (Undocumented*)calloc(sizeof(Undocumented));
    /* Do more stuff... */
}

MMRESULT waveOutWrite( handle, LPWAVEHDR hdr, ...) {

    /* The following assignment fails rarely, causing the problem: */
    hdr-&gt;reserved-&gt;p1 = malloc( /* chunk of private data */ );
    /* Probably more code to initiate playback */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Normally, the header is returned to the application by waveCompleteHeader(), a function internal to wdmaud.dll. waveCompleteHeader() tries to deallocate the pointer allocated by waveOutWrite() by calling GlobalHandle()/GlobalUnlock() and friends. Sometimes, GlobalHandle() bombs, as shown above.</p>

<p>Now, the reason that GlobalHandle() bombs is not due to a heap corruption, as I suspected at first - it's because waveOutWrite() returned without setting the first pointer in the internal structure to a valid pointer. I suspect that it frees the memory pointed to by that pointer before returning, but I haven't disassembled it yet.</p>

<p>This only appears to happen when the wave playback system is low on buffers, which is why I'm using a single header to reproduce this.</p>

<p>At this point I have a pretty good case against this being a bug in my application - after all, my application is not even running. Has anyone seen this before?</p>

<p>I'm seeing this on Windows XP SP2. The audio card is from SigmaTel, and the driver version is 5.10.0.4995.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>To prevent confusion in the future, I'd like to point out that the answer suggesting that the problem lies with the use of malloc()/free() to manage the buffers being played is simply wrong. You'll note that I changed the code above to reflect the suggestion, to prevent more people from making the same mistake - it doesn't make a difference. The buffer being freed by waveCompleteHeader() is not the one containing the PCM data, the responsibility to free the PCM buffer lies with the application, and there's no requirement that it be allocated in any specific way.</p>

<p>Also, I make sure that none of the waveOut API calls I use fail.</p>

<p>I'm currently assuming that this is either a bug in Windows, or in the audio driver. Dissenting opinions are always welcome.</p>

<p>If I use this SQL, I can get the data in the proper order:</p>

<p>This will give me the item with the lowest priority number (most important) at the top, and in those priority numbers, the earliest into the queue (by timestamp) at the top.</p>

<p>I could run this query, and only take the first row, but I would rather do this with a SQL query that would give me the one row of the process that is at the top of the queue (in the example data above, the row with id=7).</p>

<p>I tried doing self joins and sub queries, but I must be having a mental block - I just can't seem to get it right.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that I am looking for a database-independent query.  I am mocking this up in SQlite, but there is a good possibility I will implement this in DB2 or Oracle.

Is it possible to do this in C#? As far as I understand there are no guarantees on when dtor in C# will run after object goes out of scope.</p>

<p>Clarification:
Any lock in general, spinlock, ReaderWriterLock, whatever.
Calling Dispose myself defeats the purpose of the pattern - to have the lock released as soon as we exit scope - no matter if we called return in the middle, threw exception or whatnot.
Also, as far as I understand using will still only queue object for GC, not destroy it immediately...</p>

<p>We are developing some in-house utilities using ASP.NET 2.0. One of which is extracting some information from databases and building an Excel workbook containing a number of spreadsheets with data based on queries into the database.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>The proof-of-concept prototype (a simple ASP.NET page that queries a single item from the database and opens Excel to add data to a worksheet) is working well when run locally on the development machines, happily creating and displaying an Excel spreadsheet as requested.  However, when run on our server, we get the following error upon trying to instantiate Excel .</p>

<p>Unable to cast COM object of type 'Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.ApplicationClass' to interface type 'Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel._Application'. This operation failed because the QueryInterface call on the COM component for the interface with IID '{000208D5-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}' failed due to the following error: No such interface supported (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80004002 (E_NOINTERFACE)).</p>

<h2>Solution?</h2>

<p>We are using the PIA for Excel 2003 and we have Excel 2003 and the PIA installed on the server. Can anyone explain why this isn't working or give us some tips on how we might track the problem down?</p>

<p>Thanks for any assistance you can provide.</p>

<p>I know I can do it by converting to an array and rebuilding the stack, but I figured there's probably a method on it already.</p>

<p>EDIT: I wrote an extension method:</p>

<pre><code>    public static void Trim&lt;T&gt; (this Stack&lt;T&gt; stack, int trimCount) 
    {
        if (stack.Count &lt;= trimCount)

<p>So, it returns a new stack upon trimming, but isn't immutability the functional way =)</p>

<p>Here's the deal:</p>

<p>MAINAPP.EXE References an hypothetical LIBRARY.DLL.</p>

<p>MAINAPP.EXE has its own MAINAPP.EXE.config.</p>

<p>If you add ""config values"" to LIBRARY.DLL (thereby creating an app.config in LIBRARY.DLL project), those values are <em>not</em> available at runtime <em>even if you copy app.config into LIBRARY.DLL.config to the right path post-build</em>.</p>

<p>The reason for the above is that even referenced libraries will read from the ""mainapp.exe"" config. </p>

<p>So far ""so good"". Now, when you add a WCF Service reference, visual studio creates or populates your app.config with the bindings/endpoints/etc.; but that's added to the project where you added the reference's config; hence, your Library.DLL.prj ends up with a nice app.config that <em>doesn't work</em> because it never gets read, nor even copied to the output directory. Now you may think that you can right click that app.config and set ""copy always"" to true. Forget it. That doesn't do anything. (You can google for that one).</p>

<p>So, given the above weird scenario, how is a regular VS2008 developer working with a .NET 3.5 project going to manage the WCF service references he adds to his Business Layer dll? Is that developer supposed to COPY and PASTE all the whole  section from the <em>useless</em> app.config in his DLL to the Mainapp.exe.config file <em>each time there's a change in the services or each time he adds/removes one</em> ?</p>

<p>I've downloaded <a href=""http://coenraets.org/blog/2008/11/using-the-sqlite-database-access-api-in-air%E2%80%A6-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> (<a href=""http://coenraets.org/blog/2008/11/using-the-sqlite-database-access-api-in-air"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://coenraets.org/blog/2008/11/using-the-sqlite-database-access-api-in-air</a>…-part-1/) code and have been looking over it and I'm trying to implement the same idea. </p>

<p>I think it's just something stupid. I'm using Flex Builder. I made a new desktop application project, didn't import anything.</p>

<p>I added a DataGrid object and bound it to an ArrayCollection:</p>

<p>I'm trying to make it so when the program initializes it will load data from a database if it exists, otherwise it'll create a new one.</p>

<p>The problem is, when the application runs, the datagrid is empty. No column headers, no data, nothing. I've tried changing a whole bunch of stuff, I've used the debugger to make sure all the functions are being called like they're supposed to. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I've compared my code to the before mentioned code, I've looked for tutorials on Google. Anyone know what I'm doing wrong?</p>

In most cases in Java ""interface"" in this sense means the language construct interface, so that you write an interface and an implementation class and that you use the interface instead of the implementation class most of the time.</p>

<p>I wonder if this is a good practice for writing domain models as well. So, for example if you've got a domain class Customer and each customer may have a list of Orders, would you <em>generally</em> also write interfaces ICustomer and IOrder. And also would Customer have a list of IOrders instead of Orders? Or would you use interfaces in the domain model, only if it is really driven by the domain, e.g. you've got at least two different types of Orders? In other words, would you use interfaces because of only technical needs in the domain model, or only when it is really appropriate with respect to the actual domain?</p>

            {                    
              DataView dv = new DataView(dt);
              dv.Sort = e.SortExpression + "" "" + e.SortDirection;    
              grvBrokerage.DataSource = dv;
              grvBrokerage.DataBind();
           }
       }
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the ObjectDataSource declaration:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:ObjectDataSource ID=""ObjectDataSource1""

"385213","1","385267","","2008-12-21 23:51:14","","9","5233","<p>This question was originally asking 'What KPIs do you use to in a software development organisation'. Unfortunately it seems that <em>KPI</em> is a four-letter word, and the immediate assumption is that KPIs are always mis-used (maybe they are?).</p>

<p>So, I've hopefully improved the question to get at the underlying goals which I originally thought KPIs were useful for. Assuming you have some process for how you (or your organisation) develops software. Secondly assume, that you (or your team) wants to become better at developing and delivery software. Finally, assume that one of the ways to improve is by refining your process. </p>

<p>Given all this, how do you know if your process refinements are having a positive impact? If these are <em>KPIs</em>, or [SMART goals](<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_(project_management)"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_(project_management)</a> please provide individual, or groups, of KPIs/SMART goals that you have found the be effective. If it is some other mechanism please explain what it is. Finally, I guess, if you don't think that improving processes is a useful thing, I guess you can explain that too.</p>

<p>The areas of improvement I think would be useful are: quality, timeliness of releases, productivity, flexibility. If there are other aspects of an individual or team of developers, then that would be interesting to know.</p>

<p>Clarifying notes:</p>

<p>The question is not about how to best adapt or change a process, or what a good process improvement process is (be it Kaizen, retrospectives, etc). Nor is it about root-cause analysis or other approaches used to determine what specific aspects of a process should be improved.</p>

<p>The use of measures to determine if process improvement has been achieved, should not be confused with ongoing, as it happens, process improvement. (That is a good thing, but it isn't what the question is about!)</p>

<p>The <em>process</em> could be anything; scrum, agile, extreme, waterfall, ad-hoc. This question isn't about which process is best for certain types of software development, rather it is how to improve that process over time.</p>

<p>Obviously the specific metric will depend on the process that is involved, and the perceived problem that is trying to be improved. This question is simply designed to get examples of metrics used, which would obviously span a number of different processes and improvement areas.</p>

<p>The metric need not be something that is used <em>all the time</em>, for example, it could just be used while testing if a process change works. (For example, it could be too expensive - time or money wise - to measure and track at all times, so you just track it will tweaking the process).</p>

<p>It is taken as a given that if implemented poorly, the use of metrics can have a detrimental effect as developers game the system or otherwise. It is assumed that the person implementing the process change is aware of this problem and has taken effective steps to mitigate it.</p>

<p>All software organisations are different and how they fit into their company, so will have different specific things expected of them within the company, however I would think that product quality, productivity, flexibility and timeliness of releases are applicable to most if not all organisations. (With obviously different emphasis depending on the specific organisation.)</p>

<p>This question has nothing to do with <em>source lines of code</em>! In particular, I am not interested in measuring programmer productivity, especially in terms of SLOCs or # of bugs fixed, or any other naive measurements. I'm interested in higher-level way a team or individual measures their improvement. I am not interested in using a single KPI to measure anyone's performance. I <strong>am</strong> interested in using a range of KPIs to measure and improve my team's software development processes.</p>

<p>I know of horror stories about KPIs being misused and being ineffective (you don't need to search very hard to find them), but I can't believe that no-one out there tries to continually improve their processes, so there must be some good examples of KPIs out there.</p>

<p>I know all about the drawbacks of simplistic metrics that are applied to individual software programmers. I am really hoping to get examples of KPIs or alternative strategies that people have found as useful, rather than all the reasons why I shouldn't be using KPIs.</p>

<p>I'm mostly interested in processes and performance related to a development organisation within a larger company, as opposed to a software development company as a whole. For example, a software company should ensure that the products have the right features for the market, but generally that is product management's role, rather than engineering. And yes, there is a complete other discussion as to why and to what extent engineers should be involved in product management, but that is a separate discussion.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Solutions which do not work (properly)</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Using java.nio.channels.FileLock</em><br>
I am able to synchronize threads from different servers using the FileLock class. But this does not work for threads
inside the same process (servlet container) since file locks are available process wide.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Using a separate file for synchronization</em><br>
I could create a separate file which indicates that a process is reading from or wrinting to the file. This solution
works for all threads but has several drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance. Creating, deleting and checking files are rather slow operations. The low weight implementations with one synchronization file will prevent parallel reading of the file.</li>
<li>The synchronization file will remain after a JVM crash making a manual clean up necessary.</li>
<li>We have had already strange problems deleting files on network file systems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Using messaging</em><br>
We could implement a messaging system which the threads would use to coordinate the file access. But this seems too complex for this problem. And again: performance will be poor.</p></li>

<p>One idea is to somehow declare a dummy local variable with the name of the element passed to the macro, assuming the set of valid identifiers in C++ is a subset of valid XML elements. Not entire sure this can be done though.</p>

Is there something I'm missing here that can increase the performance when deleting these rows.</p>

<p>Additionally, The user was not experiencing these delays in Excel 2003, with the same code.  Thanks in advance</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>In response to the redundancy of the ClearContents line, this is the original code that was working in Excel 2003, thats why I left it.  Commenting this line was one of the first things I tried, as I agreed that it may've been redundant.  See below for my psuedo perfomance metrics.</p>

<p><strong>Test1</strong></p>

<pre><code>Selection.ClearContents  ''//  Takes ~30 mins
Selection.Delete Shift:=xlUp  ''// then this takes &lt;1min
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Test2</strong></p>

<pre><code>'Selection.ClearContents  '// If this line is commented
Selection.Delete Shift:=xlUp  ''// then this line takes ~30 mins

<p>The reason I believe it has something to do with the WrapText feature is because when you clear the line of WrapText it performs and AutoFit operation on the row.  I thought that hiding screen updates or disabling events would help.</p>

"244001","1","244040","","2008-10-28 16:44:26","","2","5239","<p>I know that cursors are frowned upon and I try to avoid their use as much as possible, but there may be some legitimate reasons to use them. I have one and I am trying to use a pair of cursors: one for the primary table and one for the secondary table. The primary table cursor iterates through the primary table in an outer loop. the secondary table cursor iterates through the secondary table in the inner loop.
The problem is, that the primary table cursor though apparently proceeding and saving the primary key column value [Fname] into a local variable @Fname, but it does not get the row for the corresponding foreign key column in the secondary table. For the secondary table it always returns the rows whose foreign key column value matches the primary key column value of the <strong>first row</strong> of the primary table. </p>

<p>Following is a very simplified example for what I want to do in the real stored procedure.
Names is the primary table</p>

<pre><code>SET NOCOUNT ON
DECLARE 
    @Fname varchar(50) -- to hold the fname column value from outer cursor loop
    ,@FK_Fname varchar(50) -- to hold the fname column value from inner cursor loop
    ,@score int
;

--prepare primary table to be iterated in the  outer loop
DECLARE @Names AS Table (Fname varchar(50))
INSERT @Names
    SELECT 'Jim' UNION
    SELECT 'Bob' UNION
    SELECT 'Sam' UNION
    SELECT 'Jo' 


--prepare secondary/detail table to be iterated in the inner loop
DECLARE @Scores AS Table (Fname varchar(50), Score int)
INSERT @Scores
    SELECT 'Jo',1 UNION
    SELECT 'Jo',5 UNION
    SELECT 'Jim',4 UNION
    SELECT 'Bob',10 UNION
    SELECT 'Bob',15 

--cursor to iterate on the primary table in the outer loop
DECLARE curNames CURSOR
FOR SELECT Fname FROM @Names


OPEN curNames
FETCH NEXT FROM curNames INTO @Fname

--cursor to iterate on the secondary table in the inner loop
DECLARE curScores CURSOR
FOR 
    SELECT FName,Score 
    FROM @Scores 
    WHERE Fname = @Fname 
 --*** NOTE: Using the primary table's column value @Fname from the outer loop

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    PRINT 'Outer loop @Fname = ' + @Fname

    OPEN curScores
    FETCH NEXT FROM curScores INTO @FK_Fname, @Score

    WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
    BEGIN
        PRINT ' FK_Fname=' + @FK_Fname + '. Score=' + STR(@Score)
        FETCH NEXT FROM curScores INTO @FK_Fname, @Score
    END
    CLOSE curScores
    FETCH NEXT FROM curNames INTO @Fname
END

DEALLOCATE curScores

CLOSE curNames
DEALLOCATE curNames
</code></pre>

<p>Here is what I get for the result. Please note that for the outer loop it DOES show the up-to-date Fname, but when that Fname is used as @Fname to fetch the relevant row from the secondary table for the succeeding iterations, it still get the rows that match the first row (Bob) of the primary table.</p>

<pre><code>Outer loop @Fname = Bob
    FK_Fname=Bob. Score=10
    FK_Fname=Bob. Score=15
Outer loop @Fname = Jim
    FK_Fname=Bob. Score=10
    FK_Fname=Bob. Score=15
Outer loop @Fname = Jo
    FK_Fname=Bob. Score=10
    FK_Fname=Bob. Score=15
Outer loop @Fname = Sam
    FK_Fname=Bob. Score=10
    FK_Fname=Bob. Score=15

<pre><code>
class A
{
public:
    A(int whichFoo);
    int foo1();
    int foo2();
    int foo3();
    int callFoo(); // cals one of the foo's depending on the value of whichFoo
};
</code></pre>

<p>In my current implementation I save the value of <code>whichFoo</code> in a data member in the constructor and use a <code>switch</code> in <code>callFoo()</code> to decide which of the foo's to call.  Alternatively, I can use a <code>switch</code> in the constructor to save a pointer to the right <code>fooN()</code> to be called in <code>callFoo()</code>. </p>

<p>My question is which way is more efficient if an object of class A is only constructed once, while <code>callFoo()</code> is called a very large number of times.  So in the first case we have multiple executions of a switch statement, while in the second there is only one switch, and multiple calls of a member function using the pointer to it.  I know that calling a member function using a pointer is slower than just calling it directly.  Does anybody know if this overhead is more or less than the cost of a <code>switch</code>?</p>

<p>Clarification:  I realize that you never really know which approach gives better performance until you try it and time it.  However, in this case I already have approach 1 implemented, and I wanted to find out if approach 2 can be more efficient at least in principle.  It appears that it can be, and now it makes sense for me to bother to implement it and try it.  </p>

<p>Oh, and I also like approach 2 better for aesthetic reasons.  I guess I am looking for a justification to implement it. :) </p>

I was looking to use JSP pages with tag libraries for handling the view layer and formatting of the HTML, but I've come across another group in my company that uses Velocity templates for the same purpose.</p>

<p>From what I can see, it seems to me as if there are a lot of similarities between the two approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li>Both have easy-to-understand syntax. Makes it easy for non-developers to understand and use, allowing the designers to focus on the HTML/CSS and only having to use directives/tag libraries in the few cases where they need conditionals/dynamic content without having to have a full understanding of Java.  </li>
<li>Simple to see which part of the content is HTML vs which are directives/logic.</li>
<li>Both are heavily used and well supported.</li>
<li>Simple to integrate with Spring MVC.</li>
</ol>

<p>But in comparing the two technologies, I can't see any specific reasons to use one versus the other. I'm having trouble thinking of any cons specific to either Velocity or JSTL.</p>

<p>So my question is, what are the pros and cons of each in your opinion? If you have built a (Spring) MVC app using one or the other, what made you decide on the view layer technology you are using and what (if anything) made you decide against the other?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I've found a similar  discussion of this same topic archived on the Spring Framework forum's <a href=""http://forum.springframework.org/archive/index.php/t-10443.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>, which might be of some interest to anyone making the same decision between JSTL and Velocity as I am.</p>

My understanding is that I could pass a stream to this constructor and it would parse it for me into a MimeMessage.  I wrote 2 tests to prove this.  The first test sends in a stream that contains only a partial multi-part MIME message.  The second test sends in a stream that contains 2 complete multi-part MIME messages.  Neither work the way I expected.  The first does not throw an exception and the second reads the entire stream into a single message somehow.

They might have a memory offset for health, x/y position, etc.  Every time the game releases an update the offsets for the various pieces of information the bot program uses must be re-found and updated as well.</p>

<p>I'm interested in writing a Solitaire bot as a pet project.  If you look here, mmoglider (a commercial bot) has already accomplished this as a demo for their botting program (which normally is used to bot WoW): <a href=""http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Oy9fOwyr4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">YouTube video of MMOGlider botting Vista Solitaire.</a></p>

<p>What is a common method of accurately locating various useful memory offsets?  How might I go about locating the memory offset that points to the ""deck"" in the solitaire program and use that to determine what cards are on the stack?  I know from experience with the glider guys that once they were able to locate the offsets for the deck itself they said that every card value for the entire deck was there.</p>

<p><strong><em>So, does anyone have any experience with reverse engineering and pulling memory offsets out of existing programs? And once you have those offsets how to be able to pull and read the values from that ""Deck"" structure in memory?</em></strong></p>

The general idea is to set the font-size in your body tag to  e.g. ""94%"" and then set all other elements with an ""em"" size like this. The reasoning is:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can then change the relative size of all the font sizes on your site by modifying the body's font-size at one point</li>
<li>users themselves can modify the size of the fonts since they are defined in ""em""</li>
</ul>

<p>However, when using ""em"" instead of ""pt"" I constantly run into issues such as the following where an element with font-size gets embedded in another element with font-size and thus becomes tiny (in the case below one vocabulary word is .8 of .8 and the other is .8 of 1.2).</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;style type=""text/css""&gt;
        body {
            font-size: 94%;
        }
        p {
            font-size: .8em;
        }
        li {
            font-size: 1.2em;
        }
        .vocabulary {
            font-size: .8em;
        }
    &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;span class=""vocabulary""&gt;egregious&lt;/span&gt; test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This is in a &lt;span class=""vocabulary""&gt;superb&lt;/span&gt; list.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course in very simple, straight-forward HTML sites this is no problem, but in the real world with imported stylesheets that perhaps you didn't even make and with dynamic sites where controls are embedded in other controls all of them outputting HTML with perhaps in-line styling, I find websites with ""em"" unit font-sizes are sometimes impossible to maintain and the way to get font-size under control is to just convert everything to hard ""px"" sizes.</p>

<p>In addition, I just checked the four main browsers and each of them have hotkeys which increase and decrease the size of ""pt"" styled fonts.</p>

<p>So here are my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>is there any real-world reason why I should use ""em"" instead of ""pt""?</li>
<li>is there trick in using ""em"" sizes so that I don't run into the embedded font-size issue above?</li>

I've got the basic testing going nicely (testing the ActionResult classes is pretty nice). One thing I do want to make sure though, is that a viewpage exists in my solution. I'm not 100% sure my test is correct, so if anyone had suggestions, please don't hesitate!</p>

<p>This is a test I have to check that my login method on my security controller is doing the right thing:</p>

<pre><code>[TestMethod]
public void Login()
{
    var authProvider = new Mock&lt;IAuthenticationProvider&gt;();
    var controller = new SecurityController(authProvider.Object);

    var result = controller.Login() as ViewResult;

    Assert.IsNotNull(result, ""ActionResult should be of type ViewResult."");
    Assert.AreEqual(result.ViewName, ""login"", ""Does not render login page."");
}
</code></pre>

<p>My explanation of the test would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>call the method 'Login' on the controller</li>
<li>Confirm it's rendering a view (by checking if it returns a ViewResult object)</li>
<li>Confirm it's rendering the right view (by checking the viewname)</li>
</ul>

<p>What I would like to have is a third assert, to see if the view to be rendered actually exists.</p>

<p>Some secondary questions I have would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I split this test up?</li>
<li>Should I rename it (like, err, LoginRendersCorrectView or something)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Note: I'm explicitly trying to avoid having to check the filesystem. I'm sort of hoping for a way to use the ViewEngine to confirm the view actually exists.</p>

Within A I have another internal component C, which is specified using mxml. When ""instantiating"" component A within mxml, I can specify the value of b at declaration, and everything works fine. However, when I initialize the component using Actionscript, I must first add the component to a rendered container before I can set the attribute (in this case 'b') of said component. This happens when the setter for attribute 'b' somehow accesses C within A.</p>

<p>So, this fails at runtime (it says that C is null)...</p>

<pre><code>var a:A = new A();
a.b = ""woopy""; //Sets the Label (declared in mxml) withn A to ""woopy""
this.addChild(a);

<p>On the other hand, either of the following will work</p>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>var a:A = new A();
this.addChild(a);
a.b = ""woopy""; //Sets the Label (declared in mxml) withn A to ""woopy""

<p>As shown, no runtime error message is thrown when a attribute is set after a component is added to a container. Ok, this makes sense, I suppose the internals of the component are not actually created until the component is added to a container. Still, this is kind of annoying. Is there any way to guarantee that the component internals are fully rendered without adding it to a container? I don't like the way it feels different when I am using actionscript vs mxml. I want a solution so that basically declaring A in mxml with no attribute ""arguments"" is equivalent to declaring A using the new operator in AS. At least, in terms of the internal state of A.</p>

"439540","1","439587","","2009-01-13 16:01:39","","5","5250","<p>First of all I have to admit that my programming skills are pretty limited and I took over a (really small) existing C++ OOP project where I try to push my own stuff in. Unfortunately I'm experiencing a problem which goes beyond my knowledge and I hope to find some help here. I'm working with a third party library (which cannot be changed) for grabbing images from a camera and will use some placeholder names here. </p>

<p>The third party library has a function ""ThirdPartyGrab"" to start a continuous live grab and takes a pointer to a function which will be called every time a new frame arrives. So in a normal C application it goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>ThirdPartyGrab (HookFunction);
</code></pre>

<p>""HookFunction"" needs to be declared as: </p>

<pre><code>long _stdcall HookFunction (long, long, void*);
</code></pre>

<p>or ""BUF_HOOK_FUNCTION_PTR"" which is declared as</p>

<pre><code>typedef long (_stdcall *HOOK_FUNCTION_PTR) (long, long, void*);
</code></pre>

<p>Now I have a C++ application and a class ""MyFrameGrabber"" which should encapsulate everything I do. So I put in the hook function as a private member like this:</p>

<pre><code>long _stdcall HookFunction (long, long, void*);
</code></pre>

<p>Also there is a public void function ""StartGrab"" in my class which should start the Grab. Inside I try to call:</p>

<pre><code>ThirdPartyGrab (..., HookFunction, ...);
</code></pre>

<p>which (not surprisingly) fails. It says that the function call to MyFrameGrabber::HookFunction misses the argument list and I should try to use &amp;MyFrameGrabber::HookFunction to create a pointer instead. However passing ""&amp;MyFrameGrabber::HookFunction"" instead results in another error that this cannot be converted to BUF_HOOK_FUNCTION_PTR. </p>

<p>After reading through the <a href=""http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/pointers-to-members.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C++ FAQ function pointers</a> I think I understand the problem but can't make up a solution. I tried to make the hook function static but this also results in a conversion error. I also thought of putting the hook function outside of the class but I need to use class functions inside the hook function. Is there another way or do I need to change my whole concept? </p>

<p>EDIT 14.01.08:
I tested the singleton workaround since I cannot change the third party library and the void pointer is only for data that is used inside the hook function. Unfortunately it didn't worked out of the box like I hoped.... I don't know if the static function needs to be in a separate class so I put it in my ""MyFrameGrabber"" class:</p>

<pre><code>static MyFrameGrabber&amp; instance()
{
        static MyFrameGrabber _instance;
        return _instance;
}
long Hook(long, long, void*); // Implementation is in a separate cpp file
</code></pre>

<p>In my cpp file I have the call_hook function:</p>

<pre><code>long MFTYPE call_hook(long x, MIL_ID y, void MPTYPE *z)
{
    return MyFrameGrabber::instance().Hook(x,y,z);
}
void
MyFrameGrabber::grab ()
{
    ThirdPartyGrab(..., call_hook, ...);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this gives me an error in <code>static MatroxFrameGrabber _instance;</code> that no matching standard constructor is found. That's correct because my MyFrameGrabber constructor looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>MyFrameGrabber (void* x,
                const std::string &amp;y, int z,
                std::string &amp;zz);
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to put in an empty constructor <code>MyFrameGrabber();</code> but this results in a linker error. Should I pass empty parameters to the MyFrameGrabber constructor in the singleton? Or do I need to have a separate Hook Class and if yes how could I access MyFrameGrabber functions? Thanks in advance. </p>

<p>SECOND EDIT 15.01.08:
I applied the changes and it compiles and links now. Unfortunately I cannot test this at runtime yet because it's a DLL and I have no Debug Caller Exe yet and there are other problems during initialization etc. I will mark the post as answer because I'm sure this is the right way to do this.</p>

In short, what it needs to do is to display a list of film titles, and allow users to give a rating (out of 10) to each film. I've been able to use the {{ form }} and {{ formset }} syntax in a template to produce a form which lets you rate one film at a time, which corresponds to one row in a MySQL table, but how do I produce a form that iterates over all the movie titles in the database and produces a form that lets you rate lots of them at once? </p>

<p>At first, I thought this was what formsets were for, but I can't see any way to automatically iterate over the contents of a database table to produce items to go in the form, if you see what I mean.</p>

<p>Currently, my views.py has this code:</p>

<pre><code>def survey(request):
        ScoreFormSet = formset_factory(ScoreForm)
        if request.method == 'POST':
                formset = ScoreFormSet(request.POST, request.FILES)
                if formset.is_valid():
                        return HttpResponseRedirect('/')
        else:
                formset = ScoreFormSet()
        return render_to_response('cf/survey.html', {
                'formset':formset,
        })
</code></pre>

<p>And my survey.html has this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""/survey/"" method=""POST""&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
{{ formset }}
&lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;input type = ""submit"" value = ""Submit""&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, and the definition of ScoreForm and Score from models.py are:</p>

<pre><code>class Score(models.Model):
        movie = models.ForeignKey(Movie)
        score = models.IntegerField()
        user = models.ForeignKey(User)

class ScoreForm(ModelForm):
        class Meta:
                model = Score
</code></pre>

<p>So, in case the above is not clear, what I'm aiming to produce is a form which has one row per movie, and each row shows a title, and has a box to allow the user to enter their score.</p>

<p>If anyone can point me at the right sort of approach to this, I'd be most grateful.</p>

<li>Absence of ""Save"" button<br>
MS OneNote as an example.<br>
IM clients can save conversation history automatically</li>
<li>Integrated search<br>
Search not only through help files but rather make UI elements searchable.<br>
Vista made a good step toward such GUI.<br>
<a href=""http://www.istartedsomething.com/20070124/scout-office-2007/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scout</a> addin Microsoft Office was a really great idea.</li>

<li>When creating new security groups within your app (we call them Departments, like ""Human Resources""), should this create new AD groups?</li>
<li>Do administrators assign users to security groups within your app or outside via AD? Does it matter?</li>
<li>Is the user signed on to your app by virtue of being signed on to Windows? If not, do you track users with your own user table and some kind of foreign key into AD? What foreign key do you use to link app users to AD users? Do you have to prove your login process protects user passwords?</li>
<li>What foreign key do you use to link app security groups to AD security groups?</li>
<li>If you have a WinForms component to your app (we have both ASP.NET and WinForms), do you use the Membership Provider in your WinForms app? Currently, our Membership and Role management predates the framework's version, so we do not use the Membership Provider.</li>

<ol>
<li>It's inefficient. It has to concat all of the values of the column as a string in some temporary storage before passing it to the md5 function</li>
<li>group_concat has a max length of 1024, after which everything else will be truncated.</li>

<p>(In case you're wondering, you can ensure that the concat of the values is in a consistent order, however, as believe it or not group_concat() accepts an order by clause within it, e.g. <code>group_concat(some_column order by some_column)</code>)</p>

<p>MySQL offers the nonstandard bitwise aggregate functions BIT_AND(), BIT_OR() and BIT_XOR() which I presume would be useful for this problem. The column is numeric in this case but I would be interested to know if there was a way to do it with string columns.</p>

<p>I have run into HMAC SHA-1 digest problems with the ObjC code, so I'm putting that to the side and looking at existing, working Perl code, to try to troubleshoot digest creation.</p>

<p>I am testing HMAC SHA-1 digest output from the <code>s3ls</code> command of the <code>Net::Amazon::S3</code> package and comparing that against the <code>_encode</code> subroutine that I pulled out and put into its own perl script:</p>

use MIME::Base64 qw(encode_base64);
use Digest::HMAC_SHA1;
use String::Escape qw( printable unprintable );

sub _ascii_to_hex {
    (my $str = shift) =~ s/(.|\n)/sprintf(""%02lx"", ord $1)/eg;
    return $str;
}

sub _encode {
    my ( $aws_secret_access_key, $str ) = @_;
    print ""secret key hex: ""._ascii_to_hex($aws_secret_access_key).""\n"";
    my $hmac = Digest::HMAC_SHA1-&gt;new($aws_secret_access_key);
    $hmac-&gt;add($str);
    my $digest = $hmac-&gt;digest;
    print ""cleartext hex: ""._ascii_to_hex($str).""\n"";
    print ""digest hex: ""._ascii_to_hex($digest).""\n"";
    my $b64 = encode_base64( $digest, '' );
    print ""encoded: "".$b64.""\n"";
}

my $secret = ""abcd1234"";
my $cleartext = ""GET\n\n\nFri, 12 Dec 2008 10:08:51 GMT+00:00\n/"";
_encode($secret, $cleartext);
</code></pre>

<p>Here is sample output from this script:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./testhmac.pl 
secret key hex: 6162636431323334
cleartext hex: 4745540a0a0a4672692c2031322044656320323030382031303a30383a353120474d542b30303a30300a2f

encoded: YzCPm4oZhEDW2GhaPz9w0KqwL2g=
</code></pre>

<p>What I am testing is that, if I input the same secret key and cleartext into the same <code>_encode</code> function of the <code>Net::Amazon::S3</code> package, I should see the very same secret key, cleartext, and digest bytes.</p>

<p>Indeed, I get the same bytes for the secret key and cleartext.</p>

<p>But I get something different for the digest (and of course the base64 encoding), e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>$ s3ls --access-key=foobar --secret-key=abcd1234
...
secret key hex: 6162636431323334
cleartext hex: 4745540a0a0a4672692c2031322044656320323030382031303a30383a353120474d542b30303a30300a2f
digest hex: c0da50050c451847de7ed055c5286de584527a22
encoded: wNpQBQxFGEfeftBVxSht5YRSeiI=
</code></pre>

<p>I have verified that the secret key and clear text are the same input to both scripts. The encoding subroutine is virtually identical in both scripts (except for an unused argument passed to the subroutine, which I remove from my custom version).</p>

<p>What would cause the HMAC SHA-1 digest to be computed differently in both cases, if the input bytes and <code>_encode</code> subroutine are the same?</p>

<li>28/12 is week 52</li>
<li>29/12 is week 1</li>
<li>1/1 is week 1</li>
<li>8/1 is week 2</li>
</ul>

<p>C# offers a GregorianCalendar class, that has a function <code>GetWeekOfYear(date, rule, firstDayOfWeek)</code>. </p>

<p>The parameter <code>rule</code> is an enumeration with 3 possible values: <code>FirstDay, FirstFourWeekDay, FirstFullWeek</code>. From what I've understood I should go for the <code>FirstFourWeekDay</code> rule, but I tried all of them just in case.</p>

<p>The last parameter informs which week day should be considered the first day of the week, according to that calendar it's Monday so Monday it is.</p>

<p>So I fired up a quick and dirty console app to test this:</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Globalization;

namespace CalendarTest
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var cal = new GregorianCalendar();
            var firstWeekDay = DayOfWeek.Monday;
            var twentyEighth = new DateTime(2008, 12, 28);
            var twentyNinth = new DateTime(2008, 12, 29);
            var firstJan = new DateTime(2009, 1, 1);
            var eightJan = new DateTime(2009, 1, 8);
            PrintWeekDays(cal, twentyEighth, firstWeekDay);
            PrintWeekDays(cal, twentyNinth, firstWeekDay);
            PrintWeekDays(cal, firstJan, firstWeekDay);
            PrintWeekDays(cal, eightJan, firstWeekDay);
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        private static void PrintWeekDays(Calendar cal, DateTime dt, DayOfWeek firstWeekDay)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""Testing for "" + dt.ToShortDateString());
            Console.WriteLine(""--------------------------------------------"");
            Console.Write(CalendarWeekRule.FirstDay.ToString() + ""\t\t"");
            Console.WriteLine(cal.GetWeekOfYear(dt, CalendarWeekRule.FirstDay, firstWeekDay));
            Console.Write(CalendarWeekRule.FirstFourDayWeek.ToString() + ""\t"");
            Console.WriteLine(cal.GetWeekOfYear(dt, CalendarWeekRule.FirstFourDayWeek, firstWeekDay));
            Console.Write(CalendarWeekRule.FirstFullWeek.ToString() + ""\t\t"");
            Console.WriteLine(cal.GetWeekOfYear(dt, CalendarWeekRule.FirstFullWeek, firstWeekDay));
            Console.WriteLine(""--------------------------------------------"");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>... and this what I get</p>

<pre><code>Testing for 28.12.2008

</code></pre>

<p>So as we see, none of the combinations above matches the official calendar (if you are in a hurry, just see that 29/12 never gets week #1).</p>

<p>What am I getting wrong here? Maybe there's something glaring that I am missing? (it's Friday and late work hours here in Belgium, bear with me ;))</p>

<p>Edit: Maybe I should explain: what I need is a function that works for any year, returning the same results as the gregorian calendar I linked. So no special workarounds for 2008. </p>

Repository&lt;T&gt; lives in a separate project called DataAccess. According to <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.dotnet.framework.aspnet/browse_thread/thread/767f1a821d9b23da/b1e045958ae427a5?lnk=st#b1e045958ae427a5"" rel=""noreferrer"">this post from the MS newsgroups</a> (relevant part copied below):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Internally, the ObjectDataSource is calling Type.GetType(string) to get the
  type, so we need to follow the guideline documented in Type.GetType on how
  to get type using generics. You can refer to MSDN Library on Type.GetType:</p>
  
  <p><a href=""http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w3f99sx1.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w3f99sx1.aspx</a></p>
  
  <p>From the document, you will learn that you need to use backtick (`) to
  denotes the type name which is using generics.</p>
  
  <p>Also, here we must specify the assembly name in the type name string.</p>
  
  <p>So, for your question, the answer is to use type name like follows:</p>
  
  <p>TypeName=""TestObjectDataSourceAssembly.MyDataHandler`1[System.String],TestObjectDataSourceAssembly""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, makes sense. When I try it, however, the page throws an exception:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:ObjectDataSource ID=""MyDataSource"" TypeName=""MyProject.Repository`1[MyProject.MessageCategory],DataAccess"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>[InvalidOperationException: The type specified in the TypeName property of ObjectDataSource 'MyDataSource' could not be found.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The curious thing is that this only happens when I'm viewing the page. When I open the ""Configure Data Source"" dialog from the VS2008 designer, it properly shows me the methods on my generic Repository class. Passing the TypeName string to Type.GetType() while debugging also returns a valid type. So what gives?</p>

<p>On an SQL Server 2005 called <strong>BHAVMSQL02</strong>, I have two databases <em>Mattercentre_dev</em> and <em>CMSNET_DEV</em>. The <em>Mattercentre_dev</em> has a stored procedure that builds a list from a table in <em>CMSNET_DEV</em>. The stored procedure looks 
like this...</p>

<pre><code>USE [Mattercentre_dev]
GO
/****** Object:  StoredProcedure [dbo].[UDSPRBHPRIMBUSTYPE]   
  Script Date:02/12/2009 10:18:10 ******/
SET ANSI_NULLS ON

GO


ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[UDSPRBHPRIMBUSTYPE] WITH EXECUTE AS 'Readuser' AS

DECLARE @SERVERNAME nvarchar(30)
DECLARE @DBASE nvarchar(30)
DECLARE @SQL nvarchar(2000)
SET @SERVERNAME = Convert(nvarchar,
  (SELECT spData FROM dbSpecificData WHERE spLookup = 'CMSSERVER'))
SET @DBASE = Convert(nvarchar,
  (SELECT spData FROM dbSpecificData WHERE spLookup = 'CMSDBNAME'))

SET @SQL =

PRINT @SQL

EXECUTE sp_executeSQL @SQL

@SERVERNAME == 'BHAVMSQL02'

@DBASE      == 'CMSNET_DEV'
</code></pre>

<p>When the stored procedure was executed the following error message appeared...</p>

<pre><code>The server principal ""ReadUser"" is not able to access the database ""CMSNET_DEV"" under the current security context.
</code></pre>

<p>After googling the error message, I carried out the following fix...</p>

<ul>
<li>Deleted the user ReadUser from
BHAVMSQL02 -> Databases ->
Mattercentre_dev -> Security -> Users</li>
<li><p>Set Up ReadUser from BHAVMSQL02 ->
Security -> Logins with the following
settings...</p>

<p>General<br>
Login Name - readUser<br>
Password - xxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
Confirm - xxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
Default db - master<br>
default lg - British English<br>
Everything Else - Unset  </p>

<p>Server Roles
Only Public Set</p>

<p>User Mappings
CMSNET_DEV - ReadUser - dbo<br>
Database Role Membership - db_owner, public  </p>

<p>Mattercentre_dev - ReadUser - dbo<br>
Database Role Membership - db_owner, public </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I then ran the following script...</p>

<pre><code>ALTER DATABASE CMSNET_DEV SET TRUSTWORTHY ON
GO
ALTER DATABASE mattercentre_dev SET TRUSTWORTHY ON
GO
</code></pre>

<p>I re-ran the stored procedure and executed it again and I still have the same
error message.</p>

<p>I have looked this question up in Stack Overflow and the suggested solutions
are similar to my own.</p>

    ...
};

class BarException : public BaseException {
public:

</code></pre>

<p>That's a nightmare isn't it? So I am considering to define different exception with template</p>

    virtual ~TemplateException () throw() {}
};

}

#define THROW(type, error) (throw TemplateRadioException&lt;type&gt;(
(error), __FILE__, __LINE__))
</code></pre>

<p>So if I have to define a new exception, I can just define a empty class like this.</p>

<pre><code>class NuclearException {};
</code></pre>

<p>To throw exception</p>

<pre><code>THROW(NuclearException , ""Boom!!"");
</code></pre>

<p>To catch</p>

<pre><code>try {

} catch (TemplateException&lt;NuclearException&gt; &amp;e) {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we want to catch all exception, we can write this</p>

<pre><code>try {

} catch (Exception &amp;e) {
   // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>It works fine, but I don't sure are there any side effects? Is this a good idea to define different type of exception? Or there is better solution? I have no idea :S</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a good, free bit-aware compressor that might work on such a stream? My main problem with the ""standard options"" is this stream should really be treated as bits, not bytes, else the structure is lost, and their overhead swamps any gain.</p>

<p>Addition:</p>

<p>The reason I want to compress these streams is because users are going to be cutting+pasting them, probably using something like base64 encoding, so saving some data is helpful.</p>

<p>Here is an example, for those who would like to see it. I'll add formatting to make it easier to read:</p>

<pre><code>110 110 - This is a 6x6 grid (the maximum is 7x7, so we only need 3 bits!)

000000
011110
010010
010010
011110
000000 - This is one layout grid

000000
000000
001000
000100
000000
000000 - This is the second layout grid
</code></pre>

<p>Now we list some pieces</p>

<pre><code>010 11111111 - A piece is a 3-bit colour code, then an 8-bit list of 'on / off' bits.
001 10101010 - Another bit!
001 10101010 - Another, identical bit!
</code></pre>

<p>The reason I say this should be considered 'as bits' is that there is obvious compression options when viewed as a bitstream (in particular, usually many 0s in the 'grid's), which disappear when you consider it as a byte-stream.</p>

<p>What amazes me about these is <strong>how different they are structurally</strong>, for instance, how they use DataBinding:</p>

<p>In the Silverlight approach, we <strong>set the DataContext of a <em>View</em> to an <em>ObservableCollection</em> in the ViewModel</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;views:QuestionView x:Name=""QuestionDataView"" /&gt;

QuestionViewModel qdata = new QuestionViewModel();
qdata.FetchQuestions();
QuestionDataView.DataContext = qdata.Questions;

</code></pre>

<p>It just seems that every MVVM example I look at does DataContext binding in a slightly new variation and I'm <strong>trying to nail down</strong> some solid ground as to ""<strong>how DataContext binding is done in the MVVM pattern</strong>"". </p>

<p>What goes through your head when you decide to bind the DataContext to something: why bind the DataContext of a <strong>Window / View / ListBox / etc.</strong> to a <strong>ObservableCollection / ModelView / etc.</strong>? What are the advantages, disadvantages, strategies here? </p>

<p>In general, we do track tasks at what I believe to be a fairly low level.  Not necessarily at a create label or textbox, but we are pretty detailed...  We also track our estimate to completion on all tasks, which I feel is a more important number than the original estimate when you're in the middle of the project.</p>

<p>I think it comes down to the perception of the users and management.  Even though they may know the estimate to completion, they still get wrapped up in the emotions and perceptions on what they are seeing and the estimate numbers take a back seat.

      &lt;TextBlock x:Name=""tb5"" TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;More than one line of text, so it will wrap onto the  following line.&lt;/TextBlock&gt;
      &lt;/Controls:WrapPanel&gt;
      &lt;/Border&gt;
&lt;/UserControl&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But the issue is that although the text blocks tb1 and tb2 will go onto the same line because there is room enough for them completely, tb3 onwards will not start on the same line as the previous block, even though it will wrap onto following lines.</p>

<p>I want each text block to start where the previous one ends, on the same line. I want to put click event handlers on some of the text. I also want paragraph breaks. Essentially I'm trying to work around the lack of FlowDocument and Hyperlink controls in Silverlight 2.0's subset of XAML.</p>

<hr>

<p>To answer the questions posed in the answers:</p>

<p><strong>Why not use runs for the non-clickable Text?</strong> If I just use individual TextBlocks only on the clickable text, then those bits of text will still suffer from the wrapping problem illustrated above. And the TextBlock just before the link, and the TextBlock just after. Essentially all of it. It doesn't look like I have many opportunities for putting multiple runs in the same TextBlock.</p>

<p>Dividing the links from the other text with RegExs and loops is not the issue at all, the issue is display layout.</p>

<p><strong>Why not put each word in an individual TextBlock in a WrapPanel</strong> Aside from being an ugly hack, this does not play at all well with linebreaks - the layout is incorrect.</p>

<p>It would also make the underline style of linked text into a broken line.</p>

<p>Here's an example with each word in its own TextBlock. Try running it, note that the linebreak isn't shown in the right place at all.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;UserControl x:Class=""SilverlightApplication2.Page""
    xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""

    &lt;Controls:WrapPanel&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock  TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;Short1 &lt;/TextBlock&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock  TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;Longer1 &lt;/TextBlock&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock  TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;Longerest1 &lt;/TextBlock&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock  TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;

&lt;/UserControl&gt;

<p><strong>What about The LinkLabelControl</strong> as <a href=""http://www.silverlightshow.net/items/Silverlight-LinkLabel-control.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/SilverlightLinkLabel"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. It has the same problems as the approach above, since it's much the same. Try running the sample, and make the link text longer and longer until it wraps. Note that the link starts on a new line, which it shouldn't. Make the link text even longer, so that the link text is longer than a line. Note that it doesn't wrap at all, it cuts off. This control doesn't handle line breaks and paragraph breaks either.</p>

<p><strong>Why not put the text all in runs, detect clicks on the containing TextBlock and work out which run was clicked</strong>
Runs do not have mouse events, but the containing TextBlock does. I can't find a way to check if the run is under the mouse (IsMouseOver is not present in Silverlight) or to find the bounding geometry of the run (no clip property).</p>

<p>There is <strong>VisualTreeHelper.FindElementsInHostCoordinates()</strong></p>

<p>The code below uses VisualTreeHelper.FindElementsInHostCoordinates to get the controls under the click. The output lists the TextBlock but not the Run, since a Run is not a UiElement.</p>

<pre><code>private void theText_MouseLeftButtonDown(object sender, System.Windows.Input.MouseButtonEventArgs e)
{
    // get the elements under the click
    UIElement uiElementSender = sender as UIElement;
    Point clickPos = e.GetPosition(uiElementSender);
    var UiElementsUnderClick = VisualTreeHelper.FindElementsInHostCoordinates(clickPos, uiElementSender);

    // show the controls
    string outputText = """";
    foreach (var uiElement in UiElementsUnderClick)
    {
        outputText += uiElement.GetType().ToString() + ""\n"";
    }
    this.outText.Text = outputText;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Use an empty text block with a margin to space following content onto a following line</strong></p>

<p>I'm still thinking about this one.
How do you calculate the right width for a line-breaking block to force following content onto the following line? Too short and the following content will still be on the same line, at the right. Too long and the ""linebreak"" will be on the following line, with content after it. You would have to resize the breaks when the control is resized.</p>

<p>Some of the code for this is:</p>

<pre><code>    TextBlock lineBreak = new TextBlock();
    lineBreak.TextWrapping = TextWrapping.Wrap;
    lineBreak.Text = "" "";
    // need adaptive width 
    lineBreak.Margin = new Thickness(0, 0, 200, 0);

"500637","1","","","2009-02-01 11:30:49","","39","5270","<p>This might be a naive question. I'm currently learning the Spring framework and <i>dependency injection</i>. While the basic principle of DI is rather easy to grasp, it's not immediately obvious why you need an elaborate framework to implement it.</p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Saw
{
    public abstract void cut(String wood);
}

public class HandSaw extends Saw
{
    public void cut(String wood)
    {
        // chop it up
    }
}

public class ChainSaw extends Saw
{
    public void cut(String wood)
    {
        // chop it a lot faster
    }
}

public class SawMill
{
    private Saw saw;

    public void setSaw(Saw saw)
    {
        this.saw = saw;
    }

    public void run(String wood)
    {
        saw.cut(""some wood"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you could simply do:</p>

<pre><code>Saw saw = new HandSaw();
SawMill sawMill = new SawMill();
sawMill.setSaw(saw);
sawMill.run();
</code></pre>

<p>Which would be equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""saw"" class=""HandSaw""/&gt;

&lt;bean id=""sawMill"" class=""SawMill""&gt;
   &lt;property name=""saw"" ref=""saw""/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>plus:</p>

<pre><code>ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(""sawmill.xml"");
SawMill springSawMill = (SawMill)context.getBean(""sawMill"");
springSawMill.run();
</code></pre>

<p>Granted, this is a contrieved example, and with more complex object relationships it might be more efficient to stash up an XML file than writing it programmatically, but surely there must be more to it than that?</p>

<p>(I know the Spring framework is more than that, but I'm thinking of the need for a DI container.)</p>

<p>In the first example it would also be trivial to change dependencies midstream:</p>

<pre><code>// gotta chop it faster
saw = new ChainSaw();
sawMill.setSaw(saw);
sawMill.run();

<p><strong>for swapping,</strong></p>

<pre><code>var next = $(""#topnd2"").next();

<p><code>topnd2</code> is an <code>id</code> of any particular tree node.</p>

<p>The database instance and Visual Studio are located on the same machine. This works fine in returning data to the web api while within development and debugging mode.

<p>I need help getting the published web api to connect to my SQL Server database from outside the development Visual Studio setup.</p>

<p>The last thing I can think of is that maybe I am incorrect in how I understand the connection string. If the web api uses the connection string to connect to the database from the server-side then it should work just fine like it does when in development calling to <code>http://localhost:port#</code> since it's all on the same machine. But, if the database string needs to be based on a client-side call then it would have to be with domain names and IP addresses.
Can someone tell me which one it is?</p>

<p>The only thing else that comes to mind is that there is something I am not doing, and need to do, inside of IIS Manager. I see connect string there as well but unsure what that is for our does since the connection string is inside the application. Also maybe I am suppose to give the app some kind of authorization to communicate with the database server even though they are on the same machine???</p>

<p>So once again I just did this, but now that there's StackOverflow, I can ask you all if people know when my writes will write ALL that I ask for versus give me back a partial write?</p>

<p>Additional comments: X-Istence's reply reminded me that I should have noted that the file descriptor was blocking (i.e., not non-blocking). I think he is suggesting that the only way a write() on a blocking file descriptor will not write all the specified data is when the write() is interrupted by a signal. This seems to make at least intuitive sense to me...</p>

The same app on other servers does not exhibit this behavior. This happens on WebSphere and Tomcat.  The environment is tricky to set up so it is difficult to try to do something like profiling within Eclipse.</p>

<p>Is there a way to profile (or some other method of inspecting) an existing Java app running in Tomcat to find out what methods are being executed while it's in this spinwait kind of state?  The app is only executing one method when it gets in this state (vendor's method). Vendor can't replicate the behavior (of course).</p>

<hr>

<p>Update:  </p>

<p>Using JConsole I was able to determine who was running and what they were doing.  It took me a few hours to then figure out why it was doing it.  The problem ended up being that the vendor's API jar that was being used did not match exactly to the the database configuration that it was using.  It was defaulting to having tracing and performance monitoring enabled on the servers that had the slight mis-match in configuration.  I used a different jar and all is well.</p>

<p>So thanks, Joshua, for your answer. JConsole was extremely easy to setup and use to monitor an existing application. </p>

<p>@Cringe - I did some experimenting with some of the options you suggested.  I had some problems with getting JProfiler set up, it looks good (but pricey).  Going forward I went ahead and added the Eclipse Profiler plugin and I'll be looking over the different open source profilers to compare functionality.</p>

<p>The problem is that when I call the <code>DSOFramer's OPEN</code> function, if I have Excel open in another window, it closes the Excel document (but leaves Excel running).  If the document it tries to close has unsaved data, I get a dialog boxclosing Excel doc in another window. If unsaved data in file, <code>dsoframer</code> fails to open with a messagebox: <code>Attempt to access invalid address</code>.  </p>

<p>I built the source, and stepped through, and its making a call in its <code>CDsoDocObject::CreateFromFile</code> function, calling <code>BindToObject</code> on an object of class IMoniker.  The <code>HR</code> is <code>0x8001010a</code> <code>The message filter indicated that the application is busy</code>.  On that failure, it tries to <code>InstantiateDocObjectServer</code> by <code>classid</code> of <code>CLSID</code> Microsoft Excel Worksheet... this fails with an <code>HRESULT</code> of <code>0x80040154</code> <code>Class not registered</code>.  The <code>InstantiateDocObjectServer</code> just calls <code>CoCreateInstance</code> on the <code>classid</code>, first with <code>CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER</code>, then (if that fails) with <code>CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER</code>.</p>

<p>I know <code>DSOFramer</code> is a popular sample project for embedding Office apps in various dialog and forms.  I'm hoping someone else has had this problem and might have some insight on how I can solve this.  I really don't want it to close any other open Excel documents, and I really don't want it to error-out if it can't close the document due to unsaved data.</p>

<p>Update 1: I've tried changing the <code>classid</code> that's passed in to <code>Excel.Application</code> (I know that class will resolve), but that didn't work.  In <code>CDsoDocObject</code>, it tries to open key <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{00024500-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\DocObject</code>, but fails.  I've visually confirmed that the key is not present in my registry; The key is present for the guide, but there's no <code>DocObject</code> subkey.  It then produces an error message box: <code>The associated COM server does not support ActiveX document embedding</code>.  I get similar (different key, of course) results when I try to use the <code>Excel.Workbook programid</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2: I tried starting a 2nd instance of Excel, hoping that my automation would bind to it (being the most recently invoked) instead of the problem Excel instance, but it didn't seem to do that.  Results were the same.  My problem seems to have boiled down to this:  I'm calling the <code>BindToObject</code> on an object of class <code>IMoniker</code>, and receiving <code>0x8001010A (RPC_E_SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER)</code> <code>The message filter indicated that the application is busy</code>.  I've tried playing with the flags passed to the <code>BindToObject</code> (via the <code>SetBindOptions</code>), but nothing seems to make any difference.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Update 3: It first tries to bind using an IMoniker class. If that fails, it calls <code>CoCreateInstance</code> for the <code>clsid</code> as a <code>fallback</code> method. This may work for other MS Office objects, but when it's Excel, the class is for the Worksheet. I modified the sample to <code>CoCreateInstance _Application</code>, then got the workbooks, then called the <code>Workbooks::Open</code> for the target file, which returns a Worksheet object. I then returned that pointer and merged back with the original sample code path. All working now.</strong></p>

<p>The main thing I miss from (X)emacs is the ""align-regex"" command, which let me take several lines into a region and then format them so that some common pattern in all lines was aligned. The simplest example of this is a series of variable assignments:</p>

<pre><code>var str = new String('aString');
var index = 0;
var longCamelCaseObjectName = new LongNameObject();
</code></pre>

<p>After doing align-regex on ""="", that would become:</p>

<pre><code>var str                     = new String('aString');
var index                   = 0;
var longCamelCaseObjectName = new LongNameObject();
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you may have your own thoughts on stylistic (ab)use of white space and alignment, etc., but that's just an example (I'm actually trying to align a different kind of mess entirely).</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me off-hand if there's an easy key-combo-shortcut for this in Eclipse? Or even a moderately-tricky one?</p>

As always I'm trying to follow best practices in setting up the project; I'm going to be using .NET 3.5, with the database being on Windows Server 2003/SQL Server 2005.</p>

<p>While I'm developing and testing the solution, should I have everything in my main project?  What I mean is... Visual Studio 2008 Professional lets you have ""database projects"" as well as all of the other types of projects.  For this application I'm going to need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Database Project containing the create and test scripts for the new data schema</li>
<li>C# projects containing the actual code/application:

<ol>
<li>Customer-facing web site(s) using ASP.NET MVC</li>
<li>Back-end order processing system, probably web-based but possibly a ""smart client""</li>
</ol></li>
<li>SSIS project containing packages to ETL the ""live"" application data provided by our vendor(s) and migrate over existing customer and order data from the legacy database.</li>
<li>Reporting project for SQL Server Reporting Services</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, I am wondering if it's a good idea to have all of these as part of one massive Visual Studio solution (let's call it ""EnterpriseSolution""), or if I should break them out and tackle them separately.  Most of the books and websites I've looked at include them all together, but they also assume a team of developers, DBAs, architects and the like - in this case I'm all of them rolled into one.  The database project and at least some ETL processes need to be done and loaded into production before the rest of the application is written, since we need to load the new vendor's products in a live environment (to start selling them).</p>

<p>I'm a little overwhelmed as to how I should begin to structure this, but I want to come up with an overall plan before I begin to lay things out and start coding.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to tackle a project like this?</p>

<p>I am doing the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not use the /MP flag on projects that are small or <strong><em>beyond</em></strong> help. (maybe I'll come back to them later)</li>
<li>Removed the #import and replaced it with a more standard MIDL-generated header (#include). This is only an option in a few places that are easy to convert to old school COM.</li>
<li>Make a new project that #imports the remaining libraries. Make that build first. #Include the .tlh files it creates in all the places that #imported previously.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm curious if anyone has <strong>any other suggestions?</strong> Also, on the <strong>last point</strong> (making a new project and using #import only there) - if you did something like this, <strong>how did you do it?</strong> What type of project, what did the ""source"" look like, where did you output files?

----         -----
FOO_ENABLED  Y

<p>The common practice is to call a generic function to test an option like this:</p>

<p>(Of course, this same option may need to be checked in many places in the system code.)</p>

<p>However, colleagues thought I'd gone overboard and objected to doing this, preferring the hard-coding because:</p>

<li>It makes it easier to see what's going on when debugging the code</li>
</ul>

<p>The trouble is, I can see their point!  Realistically, we are never going to rename the options for any reason, so about the only advantage I can think of for my function is that the compiler would catch any typo like fo_enabled(), but not 'FO_ENABLED'.</p>

Right now I'm cheating by hiding everything again and then toggling the element clicked on. This works, unless i want EVERYTHING to disappear again. Short of adding a ""Hide All"" button/link what can i do? I would like to be able to click on the link again, and hide it's content.</p>

<p>EDIT: Pseudo's code would have worked, but the html here mistakenly led you to believe that all the links were in one div. instead of tracking down where they all were, it is easier to call them by their ID.</p>

<p>Here's what I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    //hides everything
    $(""#infocontent *"").hide();

    //now we show them by which they click on
    $(""#linkjoedhit"").click(function(event){
      $(""#infocontent *"").hide();
      $(""#infojoedhit"").toggle();
      return false;
    });

    $(""#linkgarykhit"").click(function(event){
      $(""#infocontent *"").hide();
      $(""#infogarykhit"").toggle();
      return false;
    });

});
</code></pre>

<p>and the html looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""theircrappycode""&gt;
    &lt;a id=""linkjoedhit"" href=""""&gt;Joe D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

    &lt;p id=""infogarykhit""&gt;Information about Gary K Hitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div
</code></pre>

<p>there are about 20 links like this. Because I am not coding the actual html, I have no control over the actual layout, which is horrendous. Suffice to say, this is the only way to organize the links/info.</p>

<p>For example, when computing the length, it may not be identical to the number of bytes - how is this supposed to be handled? Reading the standard, I'm probably fine using a <code>char</code> array for storage, but I'll still need to write functions like <code>strlen</code> etc. on my own, which work on encoded text, cause as far as I understand the problem, the standard routines are either ASCII only, or expect wide literals (16bit or more), which are not recommended by the unicode standard. So far, the best source I found about the encoding stuff is a post on <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Joel's on Software</a>, but it does not explain what we poor C++ developer should use :)</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<p>To clarify, I have an update panel in one user control, the other update panels are in other user controls, so they can't see each other unless I were to expose some custom properties and use findControl etc etc...</p>

<p>Edit Again:</p>

<p>Here is what I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>public void Update()
{
    recursiveUpdate(this); 
}

private void recursiveUpdate(Control control)
{
    foreach (Control c in control.Controls)

<p>I had 3 main user controls that were full of update panels, these controls were visible to the main page, so I added an Update method there that called Update on those three.</p>

<p>In my triggering control, I just cast this.Page into the currentpage and called Update.</p>

<p>This works smoothly, at first. The problem is that after running for a while, eventually both UIActionSheet pointers (class variables actionSheet1 &amp; actionSheet2 in the code example above) will end up pointing to the same memory, depending on what happens at runtime, thereby causing both if statements in the delegate method to evaluate true. Not good.</p>

<p>Now, if I were to alloc each UIActionSheet only once per run and hold on to the memory (never call release), this should not happen. But I am trying to be conservative here. Does Apple intend for the delegate to be used in this way?</p>

<p>In particular, what are the optimization techniques related to virtual functions? Virtual functions are implemented through virtual tables in memory. Is there some way to pre-fetch these virtual tables onto L2 cache (the cost of fetching from memory/L2 cache is increasing)? </p>

The specifics of the OS itself are irrelevant if I can't get multi-tasking, memory management, and other basic things up and running, so I need to work on that first. I've some questinos about designing a malloc routine.</p>

<p>I figure that malloc() is either going to be a part of the kernel itself (I'm leaning towards this) or a part of the program, but I'm going to have to write my own implementation of the C standard library either way, so I get to write a malloc. My question is actually rather simple in this regard, how does C (or C++) manage its heap?</p>

<p>What I've always been taught in theorey classes is that the heap is an ever expanding piece of memory, starting at a specified address, and in a lot of senses behaving like a stack. In this way, I know that variables declared in global scope are at the beginning, and more variables are ""pushed"" onto the heap as they are declared in their respective scopes, and variables that go out of scope are simply left in memory space, but that space is marked as free so the heap can expand more if it needs to.</p>

<p>What I need to know is, how on earth does C actually handle a dynamically expanding heap in this manner? Does a compiled C program make its own calls to a malloc routine and handle its own heap, or do I need to provide it with an automatically expanding space? Also, how does the C program know where the heap begins?</p>

<p>Oh, and I know that the same concepts apply to other languages, but I would like any examples to be in C/C++ because I'm most comfortable with that language. I also would like to not worry about other things such as the stack, as I think I'm able to handle things like this on my own.</p>

<p>So I suppose my real question is, other than malloc/free (which handles getting and freeing pages for itself, etc) does a program need the OS to provide anything else?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em> I'm more interested in how C uses malloc in relation with the heap than in the actual workings of the malloc routine itself. If it helps, I'm doing this on x86, but C is cross compiler so it shouldn't matter. ^_^</p>

<p>EDIT FURTHER: I understand that I may be getting terms confused. I was taught that the ""heap"" was where the program stored things like global/local variables. I'm used to dealing with a ""stack"" in assembly programming, and I just realized that I probably mean that instead. A little research on my part shows that ""heap"" is more commonly used to refer to the total memory that a program has allocated for itself, or, the total number (and order) of pages of memory the OS has provided.</p>

<p>So, with that in mind, how do I deal with an ever expanding <em>stack</em>? (it does appear that my C theory class was mildly... flawed.)</p>

<p>My experience with floating point variables has always involved 4-byte multiples, like singles (32 bit), doubles (64 bit), and long doubles (which I've seen refered to as either 96-bit or 128-bit). That's why I was a bit confused when I came across an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_precision"" rel=""noreferrer"">80-bit extended precision data type</a> while I was working on some code to read and write to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Interchange_File_Format"" rel=""noreferrer"">AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) files</a>: an extended precision variable was chosen to store the sampling rate of the audio track.</p>

dict_2[""FooBar2.avi""]=[movie_duration,movie_type,comments]

dict_database[SomeUniqueIdentifier1]=dict_1
dict_database[SomeUniqueIdentifier2]=dict_2
dict_database[SomeUniqueIdentifier3]=dict_3

<p>Or am I missing something?  (And don't say you can use the template to help because it's jsut moving the spaghetti to another location - sweeps it under the rug - it doesn't fix the problem)</p>

<p>I guess the best way to describe it would be: like ""Guitar Hero"", but with no canned tracks. All original music--composed by you, on the fly--but the software would use its knowledge of music theory (as well as some supervised learning algorithms) to make sure that your input gets turned into something that sounds great.</p>

<p>It sounds a little silly, explaining it like that, but there ya go. It's something I think would make an interesting side project.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'm looking for a Java library for generating the actual audio. Browsing around on sourceforge, there are countless software synths, and I have no idea which to choose.</p>

<p>My top priority is that it should sound incredible... Really rich, layered, textured synths, with gobs of configurable parameters. Emulation of acoustic instruments is not important to me.</p>

<p>My second priority is that it ought to be straightforward to use strictly as a library, with no GUI involved at all. (If there's a synth with really breathtaking output, but it's tightly-coupled with a GUI, then I might consider ripping the audio portion out of the application, but I'd rather start with a nicely contained library).</p>

<p>I know I could send MIDI to a standalone synth, but I think it'd be cool to read the actual synth code and learn a little DSP while I'm at it.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I'm on Windows, so posix-only stuff is a no go.</p>

<p>Since the user has to interact with the image directly, I need to be able to convert the PictureBox click coordinates to image coordinates.</p>

<p>What I have done so far, is compare the aspect ratio of the PictureBox to the aspect ratio of the image. For example, if the PictureBox is ""more widescreen"" in relation to the image (see screenshot), it means the PictureBox will stretch the image to its own height and center it horizontally, showing its background color (in this case red) to the left and right of the image. Then I assume the image's displayed height is the same as PictureBox.Height, and work from there.</p>

<p>There's a problem, though. As you can see in the screenshot (green annotation mine), the white image being stretched to fit (zoomed) inside the red PictureBox leaves a small margin at the bottom.</p>

<p><a href=""http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/3541/bordernl6.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">screenie http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/3541/bordernl6.th.png Click for full-size.</a></p>

<p>This doesn't happen for all PictureBox.Size / Image.Size combinations, though. This leads me to believe there must be a better way to do this.</p>

<hr>

<p>Sure, I'll do that. I just have to adapt the code to remove the context dependency.</p>

<p>But the margin at the bottom does not come from my code. It comes from the PictureBox itself. Do me a favor and try the following:</p>

<p>Add a PictureBox (PictureBox1) to a Form, dock it to all four sides of the Form. The code should look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Public Class Form1

    Private Sub Form1_Shown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Shown

        PictureBox1.SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode.Zoom

        PictureBox1.BackColor = Color.Red
        PictureBox1.Image = New Bitmap(PictureBox1.Width, PictureBox1.Height)
        Dim g As Graphics = Graphics.FromImage(PictureBox1.Image)

        g.FillRectangle(Brushes.White, 0, 0, PictureBox1.Image.Width, PictureBox1.Image.Height)

    End Sub

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>Run it and resize the Form so that the image is stretched (zoomed) to fill the height of the PictureBox, leaving red bars to the left and right of the white square. Now resize the Form vertically, as slow as you can. You should see a red margin at the bottom every now and then.</p>

<p>The same thing happens with the width and a horizontal resize, showing a margin to the right.</p>

<p>It's because of this small imperfection that I know the zoom factor cannot be calculated the way I have been doing it; the result would only be an approximate. If after trying this you still think the code is relevant, then I'll gladly post it.</p>

Allow the user to delete a record by dragging a row from an AdvancedDataGrid, dropping it onto a trash-can icon and verify the user meant to do that via a popup alert with ""OK"" and ""Cancel"" buttons.  </p>

I understand that this means that the objects state should not change after it has been created. This is kind of a new way of thinking for me, but it makes sense in many cases.</p>

<p>Ok, so I start creating immutable value-objects. </p>

<ul>
<li>I make sure they take the entire state as parameters to the constructor, </li>
<li>I don't add property setters, </li>
<li>and make sure no methods are allowed to modify the content (only return new instances).</li>
</ul>

<p>But now I want to create this value object that will contain 8 different numeric values. If I create a constructor having 8 numeric parameters I feel that it will not be very easy to use, or rather - it will be easy to make a mistake when passing in the numbers. This can't be good design.</p>

<p><em>So the questions is:</em> Are there any other ways of making my immutable object better.., any magic that can be done in C# to overcome a long parameter list in the constructor? I'm very interested in hearing your ideas..</p>

<p>I am using WPF to animate canvases, and I am using the <code>BeginAnimation</code> method to translate (move) a canvas across another canvas.</p>

<p>With the BeginAnimation, I need to specify the <code>From</code> and <code>To</code> coordinates for both x and y, and this is the method I am using this like such:</p>

<pre><code>//X 
Animator_Body_X.From = Translate_Body.X; //Current x-coordinate
Animator_Body_X.To = //The end X-coordinate
Translate_Body.BeginAnimation(TranslateTransform.XProperty, Animator_Body_X);

//Y
Animator_Body_Y.From = Translate_Body.Y; //Current y-coordinate
Animator_Body_Y.To = //The end Y-coordinate
Translate_Body.BeginAnimation(TranslateTransform.YProperty, Animator_Body_Y);
</code></pre>

<p>Now the canvas needs to be translated using a given angle, which I have available from the method.</p>

<p>So my question is, <strong>given the angle (0-359) the canvas is currently rotated at, starting x and y coordinates (of where the canvas is currently situated) and distance (in px), how do I calculate to end coordinates?</strong> ie to where the canvas will finally be translated to.</p>

<p><a href=""http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/4794/canvastranspositionmi5.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">alt text http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/4794/canvastranspositionmi5.jpg</a></p>

<p>In the above image, I have drawn an example of what I want to achieve.</p>

<p>Suppose the canvas (solid-border box) has a current heading (angle) of 130 degrees, and it needs to be translated (following a path down that angle; ie depending on where it is currently facing) by 200 pixels...what will be the new coordinates (where it will stop animating: dashed-border box) of the canvas? How do I calculate these new coordinates of where it will stop?</p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE] Solution:</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to the help of both <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/534424/math-in-wpf-getting-new-x-y-coordinates-after-a-translation/534475#534475"">Andy</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/534424/math-in-wpf-getting-new-x-y-coordinates-after-a-translation/534628#534628"">Cameron</a>, it is finally working as intended.  </p>

<p>And here is the working code:</p>

<pre><code>double headingRadians = Heading * (Math.PI / 180);

Animator_Body_X.From = Translate_Body.X;
Animator_Body_X.To = Math.Sin(headingRadians) * pix + Translate_Body.X;
Translate_Body.BeginAnimation(TranslateTransform.XProperty, Animator_Body_X);

Animator_Body_Y.From = Translate_Body.Y;
Animator_Body_Y.To = ((Math.Cos(headingRadians) * pix) * -1) + Translate_Body.Y;
Translate_Body.BeginAnimation(TranslateTransform.YProperty, Animator_Body_Y);

The mainframe makes a nightly dump into sql server, such that each of our clients has it's own database in the server.   There are a few other databases in the server instance as well, plus some older client dbs with no data.</p>

<p>We often need to run reports or check data across all clients.  I would like to be able to run queries using sp_msforeachdb or something similar, but I'm not sure how I can go about filtering unwanted dbs from the list.  Any thoughts on how this could work?  </p>

<p>We're still on SQL Server 2000, but should be moving to 2005 in a few months.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><br>
I think I did a poor job asking this question, so I'm gonna clarify my goals and then post the solution I ended up using.</p>

<p>What I want to accomplish here is to make it easy for programmers working on queries for use in their programs to write the query using one client database, and then pretty much instantly run (test) code designed and built on one client's db on all 50 or so client dbs, with little to no modification.</p>

<p>With that in mind, here's my code as it currently sits in Management Studio (partially obfuscated):</p>

<pre><code>use [master]
declare @sql varchar(3900) 

set @sql = 'complicated sql command added here'

-----------------------------------
declare @cmd1 varchar(100)
declare @cmd2 varchar(4000)
declare @cmd3 varchar(100)
set @cmd1 = 'if ''?'' like ''commonprefix_%'' raiserror (''Starting ?'', 0, 1) with nowait'
set @cmd3 = 'if ''?'' like ''commonprefix_%'' print ''Finished ?'''
set @cmd2 = 
    replace('if ''?'' like ''commonprefix_%'' 
    begin 
        use [?]
        {0} 
    end', '{0}', @sql)

exec sp_msforeachdb @command1 = @cmd1, @command2 = @cmd2, @command3 = @cmd3
</code></pre>

<p>The nice thing about this is all you have to do is set the @sql variable to your query text.  Very easy to turn into a stored procedure.  It's dynamic sql, but again: it's only used for development (famous last words ;) ).  The downside is that you still need to escape single quotes used in the query and much of the time you'll end up putting an extra <code>''?'' As ClientDB</code> column in the select list, but otherwise it works well enough.  </p>

<p>Unless I get another really good idea today I want to turn this into a stored procedure and also put together a version as a table-valued function using a temp table to put all the results in one resultset (for select queries only).</p>

<p>Context: <em>I'm dealing with a situation where I am triggering a third-party application to open several non-modal windows and I need to send some window messages to those windows once they're open, yet I have no sure-fire way of identifying them as neither their window classes nor their captions will differ and I also do not know their expected coordinates.

<pre><code>public JsonResult JoinMailingList(string txtEmail)
{
        // ...

       {
           Data = new { foo = ""123"", success = true }

<p>However (at least according to my first impression) this really isn't a good separation of concerns.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unit test methods are harder to write becasue they don't have nice strongly typed data to test and have to know how to interpret the Json.</li>
<li>Its harder for some other View in future that isn't over HTTP (or any remote protocol involving serialization) to be 'plugged in' because its unnecessary in such cases to be serializing and deserializing the response.</li>
<li>What if you have TWO different places that need the results of that action? One wants Json and another wants XML or perhaps a fully <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/227624/asp-net-mvc-controller-actions-that-return-json-or-partial-html"">or partially</a> rendered view.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm wondering why the translation between an object and Json wasn't implemented declaratively via an attribute. In the code below you're essentially telling MVC that <code>this method is convertible to Json</code>, and then if it is called from an AJAX client a check is made for the attribute the <code>new JsonResult()</code> conversion performed internally.</p>

<p>Unit testing can just take the action result (<code>ObjectActionResult</code>) and pull out the strongly typed <code>Foo</code>.</p>

<pre><code>[JsonConvertible]
public ActionResult JoinMailingList(string txtEmail)
{
        // ...

       return new ObjectActionResult()
       {
           Data = new Foo(123, true)
       };
}

<p>I was just curious as to people's thoughts and any alternative pattern to follow.</p>

<p>These are also just my initial observations - there are probably more reasons why this is not an ideal design (and probably plenty why its a perfectly acceptable and practical one!) I'm just feeling theoretical and devils-advocatey tonight.</p>

<p>We are using a Scrum process to develop the software, albeit tailored to fit with our team and environment, and this is working quite well.  We're coming to the end of a sprint and the software is at a stage where the product owner wants to deploy it.</p>

<p>Previously, i.e. before Scrum, we would have deployed the software.  Now I feel like we have developed the software, we've passed all the user-defined/agreed release tests and demonstrated the software to the PO with a simulator, <b>we have achieved our goals</b>.  We are ready to provide deployment support but I don't think it should be our responsibilty to deploy.</p>

<p>What are other peoples experiences?  Should the dev team do the deployment or should we just hand over the completed software to the PO and provide support?</p>

<p>A lot of great responses, thanks.  The question may seem like I'm trying to squirm out of work or responsibility, maybe I am a little ;o)  What I'm more interested in is other peoples processes.  The problem we face here is that if the dev team deploy the software then we end up providing 24/7 support to production for the software.  No prob, except there are only two of us.  So, to allow us to get back to developing software rather than providing support all the time I thought it might be helpful to get the ""IT"" team involved in development process.  Hopefully this will get the 'buy-in' and then allow them to deploy and provide first level support.  We also have a plant in Mexico and its difficult for the dev team to go and deploy there, it makes more sense for the local support to do it, with guidance/advice from the developers.</p>

<p>Just to let you know, the IT engineers did deploy the software, with guidance/advice from dev.  Its gone quite well, the customer is happy - he's got increased value for his software, and isn't that what its all about?</p>

<ul>
<li>For local static variables within a function, the variable is initialized at startup and the value is saved across function calls.</li>

<li>Static member functions have access only to static members.</li>
<li>In recursive code, a static object or variable is guaranteed to have the same state in different instances of a block of code.</li>

The main problem I am having is when I create a UserControl for example a simple one which shows an object different colours - I have successfully created a property for this and can assign the colours to this UserControl at Design Time and it works - shows Green, Red etc.<br>
However when I give this UserControl a name so I can assign this Property at Runtime I get an error ""Could not create instance of type 'MyUserControl'"" if I remove the name the user control works - I can add as many as I want at Design Time and they all work but as soon as I assign a Name or x:Name it breaks and I cannot figure out why.<br>
It is possible to create a Label for example and it has a name I can refer to it in code - why not my own control - no matter how simple.</p>

<p>My main problems are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why does giving my UserControl a
Name or x:name stop it from working?</li>
<li>How to use multiple
UserControls of the same type on a
Window?</li>
<li>How to access the Canvas, Label
etc of a UserControl from inside or
outside the UserControl?</li>
<li>How to instance a UserControl at
runtime or at design time in code or XAML?</li>

<p>I have a table of approximately 200,000 address locations hosted on a <strong><em>SQL 2000 Server</em></strong>. This table has a huge problem with duplicate data in the table caused by invalid input from various parties over the years. I need to output a list of duplicate records so I can begin the long process of cleaning them up.</p>

<p>So consider the following table structure:</p>

<pre><code>Table Company(   
  CompanyId NVarChar(10) Not Null Constraint PK_Locations Primary Key,   
  CompanyName NVarChar(30),   
  CompanyAddress NVarChar(30),   
  CompanyCity NVarchar(30), 
  CompanyState Char(2),   
  CompanyZip NVarChar(10),   
  DateCreated DateTime, 
  LastModified DateTime,  
  LastModifiedUser NVarChar(64) 
)
</code></pre>

<p>For the first parse I'm not even going to worry about typos and variations of spelling yet which is going to be a greater nightmare down the road that I haven't even got the first clue about solving yet.</p>

<p>So for this part a record is considered to be duplicate when multiple records match on the following conditions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(CompanyName Or CompanyAddress) And CompanyCity And CompanyState</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zip is excluded because so many of the locations are missing zip/postal codes and so many are entered incorrectly that it just makes for a far less accurate report if I include them.</p>

<p>I realize that there may legitimately be multiple locations for a company within a single city/state [for instance McDonalds, just off the top of my head], and there may legitimately be multple companies at a single address within a city and state [for instance inside a shopping mall or office building], but for now we will consider that these at least warrant some level of human attention and will include them in the report.</p>

<p>Matches on single fields are a piece of cake, but I'm coming unstuck when I get to multiple fields, especially when some are conditional.</p>

My inquiry is two-fold, but because both are related I think it is a good idea to put them together.</p>

<ul>
<li>How to programmatically create queries. I know I could start creating strings and get that string parsed with the query parser. But as I gather bits and pieces of information from other resources, there is a programattical way to do this.</li>
<li>What are the syntax rules for the Lucene queries?</li>
</ul>

<p>--EDIT--  </p>

<p>I'll give a requirement example for a query I would like to make:<br>
Say I have 5 fields:</p>

<ol>
<li>First Name</li>
<li>Last Name</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Everything</li>
</ol>

<p>All fields are optional, the last field should search over all the other fields.
I go over every field and see if it's IsNullOrEmpty(). If it's not, I would like to append a part of my query so it adds the relevant search part.<br>
First name and last name should be exact matches and have more weight then the other fields. Age is a string and should exact match. Address can varry in order. Everything can also varry in order.</p>

<p>How should I go about this?</p>

I have a table, a bit like Apple's addressBook.app that uses different cell subclasses to display information in different ways. On this particular app I have 3 different UiTableViewCell subclasses, all with their own nibs.</p>

<p>I can't get the code right :-( if I try and access the instance variable of my cell in the CellForRowPath method it says' (ERROR request for member 'type' in something not a structure or union') Now I assume that the word 'something' is the root of my problem.. The code I am about to paste obviously doesn't setup my cell properly. Here is the code:</p>

<p>There are 3 if statements to get the right cell subclass depending on the section being called:</p>

static NSString *PoolFacilityCellIdentifier = @""PoolFacilityCellIdentifier"";
static NSString *PoolFacilityAddressCellIdentifier = @""PoolFacilityAddressCellIdentifier"";

//Creat a generic container for cell which will be cast during one of the next two statements
id cell;

//Change the identifier depending on cell type. MIGHT NEED TO ADD SOMETHING ELSE FOR POOLS AND PRICES

    cell = (PoolFacilityAddressCell *)[tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:PoolFacilityAddressCellIdentifier];

Specifically, I'm working on an app to track animal breeding.  Each animal has an ID; it's also got a sire ID and a dame ID.  So it's possible to have a one to many from the sire or dame to its offspring.  I would be inclined to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
SIRE_ID INT 
DAME_ID INT
</code></pre>

<p>and record a null value for those animals which were purchased and added to the breeding stock and an ID in the table for the rest.  </p>

<p>So:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can someone point me to an
article/web page that discusses
modeling this sort of relationship?</li>
<li>Should the ID be an INT or some sort
of String?  A NULL in the INT would
indicate that the animal has no
parents in the database but a String
with special flag values could be
used to indicate the same thing.</li>
<li><p>Would this possibly be best modeled
via two tables?  I mean one table
for the animals   and a separate
table solely indicating kinship e. g.:</p>

<p>Animal</p>

<p>ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY</p>

<p>Kinship</p>

<p>ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY</p>

<p>SIRE_ID INT PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY</p>

<p>DAME_ID INT PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY</p></li>

<p>Unfortunately, if you change any of the project file's properties, Visual Studio insists on randomly shuffling the XML nodes of the project file! This makes textual diffing and merging of project file changes basically impossible. Changing one compiler setting can make my visual diff tool think I've changed 50% of the lines in the file! I've even tried some XML diff tools, but they just show a more structured view of the same mess.</p>

<p>Our problem is that we are building a complex (as in, many objects refer to each other) stateful RIA system. It seems as Hibernate is designed to be used mainly on one-off applications - JSF and the like.</p>

<p>The problem is mainly that of lazy loading. Since there can be several HTTP requests between the initialization and actually loading lazy collections, a session per transaction is out of the question. A long-lived session (one per application) doesn't work well either, because once a transaction hits a snag and throws an exception, the whole session is invalidated, thus the lazy loaded objects break. Then there's all kinds of stuff that just don't work for us (like implicit data persisting of data from outside an initialized transaction).</p>

<p>My poor explanations aside, the bottom line is that Hibernate does magic we don't like. It seems like TopLink isn't any better, it also being written on top of EJB.</p>

<p>So, a stateless persistence layer (or even bright-enough object-oriented database abstraction layer) is what we would need the most.</p>

<p>If you want something concrete to visualize, imagine that your routine has to take data like:</p>

<pre><code>[ [ 'top hat', 'bowler', 'derby' ], [ 'bow tie', 'cravat', 'ascot', 'bolo'] ... ['jackboots','galoshes','sneakers','slippers']]
</code></pre>

<p>and make the following procedure calls (in any order):</p>

<pre><code>try_on ['top hat', 'bow tie', ... 'jackboots']
try_on ['top hat', 'bow tie', ... 'galoshes']
 :
try_on ['derby','bolo',...'slippers']
</code></pre>

<p>This is sometimes called a chinese menu problem, and for fixed <code>n</code> can be coded quite simply (e.g. for <code>n</code> = 3, in pseudo code)</p>

<pre><code>procedure register_combination( items : array [1..3] of vararray of An_item)
    for each i1 from items[1]
        for each i2 from items[2]
            for each i3 from items[3]
                register( [ii,i2,i3] )
</code></pre>

<p>But what if <code>n</code> can vary, giving a signature like:</p>

<pre><code>procedure register_combination( items : vararray of vararray of An_item)
</code></pre>

<p>The code as written contained an ugly case statement, which I replaced with a much simpler solution.  But I'm not sure it's the best (and it's surely not the only) way to refactor this.</p>

<p>How would you do it?  Clever and surprising are good, but clear and maintainable are better--I'm just passing through this code and don't want to get called back.  Concise, clear <em>and</em> clever would be ideal.</p>

<p>I am wondering if it is possible when clicking a link to execute a query and then call my update method and refesh tge page. Is there any easy way to do this given my update methods?</p>

<p>I would like to avoid rewriting my update method if possible. </p>

<p>WOuld the simplest method be to have the php page(only in the layer) reload itself after executing a mysql query?</p>

<p>Or to make a new ""alterstatus"" method, which would pass delete or watch as a paramter, and have the php execute a query accordingly and then update the page?</p>

<p>edit: The links are generated like so. deleterec would be called from an additional link generated.</p>

<p>{</p>

<pre><code>$pk = $row['ARTICLE_NO'];

echo '&lt;tr&gt;' . ""\n""; 

    echo '&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""updateByPk(\'Layer2\', \'' . $pk . '\')""&gt;'.$row['USERNAME'].'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;' . ""\n""; 

echo '&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""updateByPk(\'Layer2\', \'' . $pk . '\')""&gt;'.$row['shortDate'].'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;' . ""\n""; 

echo '&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""updateByPk(\'Layer2\', \'' . $pk . '\')""&gt;'.$row['ARTICLE_NAME'].'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;' . ""\n""; 


echo '&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""deleteRec(\'Layer2\', \'' . $pk . '\')""&gt;'.$row['ARTICLE_NAME'].'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;' . ""\n""; 

echo '&lt;/tr&gt;' . ""\n""; 
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>edit: the update method can not be modified, as it is used by the updateByPk and updateBypg methods which need a layer.</p>

<p>Using SVN and/or Tortoise SVN (or any other SVN tool, really), is it possible to view the history for a specific line of a file?</p>

<p>Recently I've had several occurrences of coming across a line in a file and wanting to find the log entry associated with its creation (either to determine how old the line of code was, or to get a larger context for why it was added).</p>

<p>Right now I'm doing this by hand.  I can display the log for the file, go back a ways, and see if the line in question is present.  If it is, I go back further.  If it isn't, I go look at a more recent revision.  Repeat until the revision where the change was made is found.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this process is awkward at best, especially for particularly old files.  Does anyone know of an automated method of accomplishing this?</p>

To me they always represented some ""magic"" that was going to happen on the database side, far far away from the control of my application code. I also wanted to limit the amount of work the DB had to do, as it's generally a shared resource and I always assumed triggers could get to be expensive in high load scenarios.</p>

<p>That said, I have found a couple of instances where triggers have made sense to use (at least in my opinion they made sense). Recently though, I found myself in a situation where I sometimes might need to ""bypass"" the trigger. I felt really guilty about having to look for ways to do this, and I still think that a better database design would alleviate the need for this bypassing. Unfortunately this DB is used by mulitple applications, some of which are maintained by a very uncooperative development team who would scream about schema changes, so I was stuck.</p>

<p>What's the general consesus out there about triggers? Love em? Hate em? Think they serve a purpose in some scenarios?

<p>The second problem is that it makes it far too easy to add a lot of logic in the GUI creation and layout code.

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Error</strong>: Abandoning transaction after secs seconds: tx</p>
  
  <p><strong>Description</strong>: When a transaction is abandoned,
  knowledge of the transaction is
  removed from the transaction manager
  that was attempting to drive the
  transaction to completion. The JTA
  configuration attribute
  AbandonTimeoutSeconds determines how
  long the transaction manager should
  persist in trying to commit or
  rollback the transaction.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Cause</strong>: A resource or participating server may 
  have been unavailable for the duration of the 
  AbandonTimeoutSeconds period.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Action</strong>: Check participating resources for heuristic 
  completions and correct any data inconsistencies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have observed that you can get rid of these warnings by deleting the *.tlog files but this doesn't seem like the right strategy to deal with the warnings.</p>

<p>The warnings refer to JMS and our JMS store.  We do use JMS.  We just don't understand why transactions are hanging out there and why they would be ""abandoned""??</p>

<p>If the compiler has to assume that <code>result</code> might overlap with <code>a</code>, it has to refetch a each time. But, as <code>a</code> is marked <code>const</code>, the compiler could also assume that a is fixed, and hence fetching it once is ok.</p>

<p>Question is, in a situation like this, what is the recommend way to work with restrict? I surely don't want the compiler to refetch <code>a</code> each time, but I couldn't find good information about how <code>restrict</code> is supposed to work here.</p>

Basically, a long running client service (on several machines) establish a duplex connection to the server over a netTcpBinding. The server then uses the callback contract of the client to perform certain on-demand oparations, to which the client responds in an asynchronous fashion (fairly standard stuff I think). I subclass the DuplexClientBase class to handle most of the communication.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when something goes wrong on either end (such as a network failure, unexpected exception, etc), the channel gets faulted/aborted and all subsequent operations fail. I've gotten around this limitation in non-duplex channels by creating a RecoveringClientBase class that automatically picks up when the client has faulted and retries the operation.</p>

<p>So my question is, is there an established way of determining when a duplex channel has faulted? Where should I check this, on the server or the client? Failing that, what options do I have to ensure that the connection gets re-established?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I'm looking for some advice specific to duplex channels, where the server might try to use a callback channel that was faulted. Thus, I need something that will immediately reconnect/resubscribe when something happens to the channel. At the moment I'm listening to the channel's Closing event and recreating it if the state is anything but Closed. It sort of works, but it feels hacky...</p>

<li>If a <b>primitive</b> element is specified inside a <b>primitive-list</b> element, then it should contain the <b>name</b> attribute and the embedded <b>definition</b> element, but not the <b>ref</b> attribute.</li>
<li>If a <b>primitive</b> element is specified in the <b>composite</b> element, then it should contain either the <b>ref</b> attribute or the <b>definition</b> element. The <b>name</b> is allowed in neither cases.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am pretty sure that it is possible since the <b>element</b> element in XML Schema itself behaves just like that. So anybody who is in possession of that sacred knowledge please share :-)</p>

<p>To create a table with this kind of data, this Transact SQL code works in SSMS:</p>

<pre><code>create table testing

insert into testing values (2, char(65) + char(1) + char(65));

<p><strong>Update: Post-mortem and workaround</strong></p>

<p>Dommer's probably right, that it's the <code>Normalization</code> property in the <code>XmlTextReader</code> that's giving me problems.  The thing is (as you can see from the comments) I found it pretty much impossible to go from a <code>(SqlCommand).ExecuteXmlReader()</code> to anything that will let me go near the <code>Normalization</code> property of an <code>XmlTextReader</code>.  Oftentimes the Microsoft documentation on this was contradictory or just plain wrong.</p>

<p>So I settled on a workaround.  If I simply use an <code>SqlDataReader</code> to soak up the output everything is fine.  The XML looks perfect and parses quite nicely.</p>

<pre><code>StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
using(SqlDataReader dr = cmd.ExecuteReader())
{
    while(rdr.Read())
        sb.Append((string)rdr[0]);
}

<p><strong>Update :</strong> </p>

<p>Thanks Kyle for the answer, </p>

<p>After re-examining my code and try the change you propose, i think the main issue is how we can we tell the dialog box his parent element (which portlet his come from). On the code above, after i click the update button, the portlet affected is always the first portlet that i drop to the main area .., i hope my explanation is clear enough for you .., thanks !</p>

<p>Btw, here is the markup of a single portlet : </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""gambarTigaSatu"" class=""portlet ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-helper-clearfix ui-corner-all"" style=""opacity: 1;""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""portlet-header ui-widget-header ui-corner-all""&gt;
               &lt;span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-plusthick""/&gt;
               &lt;span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-wrench"" id=""setup-gambarTigaSatu""/&gt;
               &lt;span class=""ui-icon ui-icon-close""/&gt;
               &lt;span class=""""/&gt;SDM yang Terlibat Kegiatan Penelitian dan Pengabdian Masyarakat (Valid)
       &lt;/div&gt;

       &lt;div class=""portlet-content""&gt;
              &lt;object width=""320"" height=""180"" data=""/swf/open-flash-chart.swf"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" style=""vertical-align: text-top;""  
        name=""chart-gambarTigaSatu"" id=""chart-gambarTigaSatu""&gt;&lt;param value=""data-file=/chart/gambarTigaSatu"" name=""flashvars""/&gt;
             &lt;/object&gt;
       &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The ui-icon-wrench id is added automatically, it's for testing only for now, i try 
to traverse the dom, and get the id of the object element from there. The object element 
also generated automatically using swfobject, u can see to code above ..
(Btw, the comment on the answer is limited to 300 char, so I post here)</p>

The problem I recently discovered is that it doesn't support nested transactions: if a transaction is started inside an another transaction, then every SQLs running in the context of the inner transaction will be executed using the same db connection, and when it's commited or rolled back it will automatically commit or roll back all the changes starting from the outer transaction.</p>

<p>As far as I understand I can implement the support for nested transaction using JDBC 3.0 savepoints: whenever a nested transaction is started, I can set a new savepoint for the current connection. Afterward, if the nested transaction is rolled back, I will just rollback to this savepoint. If, on the other hand, it is commited, I will just do nothing. Only the commit of the most outer transaction will save the changes to the db.</p>

<p>Is this correct? Does this approach have any flaws? If yes, what are my possibilities?</p>

"167131","1","168878","","2008-10-03 14:27:07","","3","5386","<p>I've inherited a large Java app that uses Struts, Spring, and Hibernate. The classes and interfaces I deal with daily are: Struts Actions, Struts ActionForms, Value Objects, Service Interfaces and Implementations, DAO Interfaces and Implementations, and Entities. I'm pretty clear on the how and why of most of these, except I'm unsure about the correct separation of responsibilities between the ActionForms, Value Objects, and Entities. I should also mention that the Domain Model (i.e. all of the entities) doesn't contain much (if any) real business logic. This is essentially a CRUD app and most of the real logic is in the database (yuck!). Anyway, there are several distinct Java related issues that I'm wondering about:</p>

<p>1) It seems there is not much difference between the Entities and the Value Objects (VOs), and a lot of code must be written to transform on into the other when they pass through the service layer in either direction (Struts Actions deal only with VOs, DAOs deal only with Entities). So, VOs and Entities seem somewhat redundant. Why have them both?</p>

<p>2) Where should the VO&lt;->Entity translation code go? The service layer, the Entity, the VO?</p>

<p>3) VOs are placed directly into ActionForms and directly bound to tags in the JSP (e.g. ). Is this a good practice? If not, what's the appropriate design?</p>

<p>4) It is unclear how to properly handle foreign key dependencies in the Value Objects. For example, certain VOs have a type field that, in database terms, represent a foreign key relationship into a type table. In the UI, this translates into a dropdown field that lets the user pick the type, OR a label that simply displays the textual representation of the type (depending on which screen it is). Now, should the VO have a property for the type ID, the textual representation of the type, or both? Who is responsible for translating between the two, and when?</p>

<p>5) The VOs have a field for their database ID. I thought VOs don't have identities? What's up with this?</p>

<p>I hope these questions are generic enough to be of general interest. It seems this would come up all the time in this type of architecture.</p>

<p>Also, I have the suspicion that this architecture is way to heavy for this app, and if you have suggestions about a better one, go ahead. But I'm mainly interested in the answer to the above questions since a different architecture is a long-term refactoring that I can't do right now.</p>

"290632","1","290658","","2008-11-14 16:22:50","","5","5386","<p><strong>Original Question</strong></p>

<p>I am writting a logging class where the goal is to be able to do this:</p>

<pre><code>// thread one
Logger() &lt;&lt; ""Some string"" &lt;&lt; std::ios::hex &lt;&lt; 45;
// thread two
Logger() &lt;&lt; L""Some wide string"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>

<p>Currently my Logger header looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#pragma once;
#include &lt;ostream&gt;    
class Logger
{
public:
    Logger();
    ~Logger();

    std::ostream* out_stream;
};

template &lt;typename T&gt;
Logger&amp; operator&lt;&lt; (Logger&amp; logger, T thing) {
    *logger.out_stream &lt;&lt; thing;
    return logger;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some notes about this class:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cross platform compatibility is not an issue.</li>
<li>Inside of Logger.cpp there is a singleton class that takes care of creating the ""real"" ostream.</li>
<li>The Logger constructor and deconstructor perform the necessary locking of the singleton.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have three problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I make the operator&lt;&lt; function a friend or member so I can set out_stream as private? </li>
<li>How do I make the operator&lt;&lt; function work for manipulators?</li>
<li>How can I add a specialization so that if T is a WCHAR* or std::wstring that it will convert it to char* or std::string before passing it to out_stream?  (I can do the conversion. Losing high unicode characters isn't a problem in my case.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary of things learned in answers:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Put template  BEFORE friend instead of after.</li>
<li>std::ios::hex is not a manipulator.  std::hex is a manipulator.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>End Result</strong></p>

<pre><code>#pragma once
#include &lt;ostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

std::string ConvertWstringToString(std::wstring wstr);

class Logger
{

    }
    Logger&amp; operator&lt;&lt; (std::wstring data) {
        return *this &lt;&lt; ConvertWstringToString(data);
    }

The first example does - because of ""Program Files""

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Devin's answer is basically what I understood to be the case. I should have mentioned that I'm using the .NET framework. So I wondered if there is perhaps a .NET library which would be able to be handle a docx file for printing? I see when adding a job to the <code>DefaultPrinterQueue</code> on a <code>LocalPrintServer</code> (in the <code>System.Printing</code> namespace) it can handle an XPS document.

<p>Currently, my code looks like this (relevant hunks shown below):</p>

<pre><code>const string highlightPattern = @""&lt;span class=""""Highlight""""&gt;$0&lt;/span&gt;"";
DataBoundLiteralControl litCustomerComments = (DataBoundLiteralControl)e.Row.Cells[CUSTOMERCOMMENTS_COLUMN].Controls[0];

// Turn ""term1 term2"" into ""(term1|term2)""
string spaceDelimited = txtTextFilter.Text.Trim();
string pipeDelimited = string.Join(""|"", spaceDelimited.Split(new[] {"" ""}, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries));
string searchPattern = ""("" + pipeDelimited + "")"";

// Highlight search terms in Customer - Comments column
e.Row.Cells[CUSTOMERCOMMENTS_COLUMN].Text = Regex.Replace(litCustomerComments.Text, searchPattern, highlightPattern, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);

<p>Amazingly it works. BUT, sometimes the text I am matching on is HTML that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class=""CustomerName""&gt;Fred&lt;/span&gt; was a classy individual.
</code></pre>

<p>And if you search for ""class"" I want the highlight code to wrap the ""class"" in ""classy"" but of course not the HTML attribute ""class"" that happens to be in there! If you search for ""Fred"", that should be highlighted.</p>

<p>So what's a good regex that will make sure matches happen only OUTSIDE the html tags? It doesn't have to be super hardcore. Simply making sure the match is not between &lt; and > would work fine, I think.</p>

<pre><code>/browse/&lt;name1&gt;/&lt;value1&gt;/&lt;name2&gt;/&lt;value2&gt;/ .... etc ....
</code></pre>

<p>where 'name' maps to a model attribute and 'value' is the search criteria for that attribute.  Each ""name"" will be treated like a category to return subsets of the model instances where the categories match.</p>

<p>Now, this could be handled with GET parameters, but I prefer more readable URLs for both the user's sake and the search engines.  These URLs subsets will be embedded on each page that displays this model, so it seems worth the effort to make pretty URLs.</p>

<p>Ideally each name/value pair will be passed to the view function as a parameter named <code>name1</code>, <code>name2</code>, etc.  However, I don't believe it's possible to defined named patterns via a regex's matched text.  Am I wrong there?</p>

<p>So, it seems I need to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^browse/(?:([\w]+)/([\w]+)/)+$', 'app.views.view', name=""model_browse""),
)
</code></pre>

<p>It seems this should match any sets of two name/value pairs.  While it matches it successfully, it only passes the last name/value pair as parameters to the view function.  My guess is that each match is overwriting the previous match.  Under the guess that the containing (?:...)+ is causing it, I tried a simple repeating pattern instead:</p>

<pre><code>urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^browse/([\w]+/)+$', 'app.views.view', name=""model_browse""),
)
</code></pre>

<p>... and got the same problem, but this time <code>*args</code> only includes the last matched pattern.</p>

<p>Is this a limitation of Django's url dispatcher, and/or Python's regex support?  It seems either of these methods should work.  Is there a way to achieve this without hardcoding each possible model attribute in the URL as an optional (.*) pattern?</p>

At the moment I control them via COM from a Python script using the latest version of the pywin32 product. Unfortunately COM seems to have a number of annoying drawbacks:</p>

<p>For example, the slightest upset seems to be able to break the connection to the COM-Server, once severed there seems to be no safe way to re-connect to the Excel application. There's absolutely no safety built into the COM Application object.</p>

<p>The Excel COM interface will not allow me to safely remote-control two seperate instances of the Excel application operating on the same workbook file, even if they are read-only.</p>

<p>Also when something does go wrong I seldom get any useful error-messages... at best I can except a numerical error-code or a barely useful message such as ""An Exception has occurred"". It's almost impossible to know why something went wrong.</p>

<p>Finally, COM lacks the ability to control some of the most fundamental aspects of Excel? For example there's no way to do a guaranteed close of just the Excel process that a COM client is connected to. You cannot even use COM to find Excel's PID.</p>

<p><strong>So what if I were to completely abandon COM?</strong> Is there an alternative way to control Excel? </p>

<p>All I want to do is run macros, open and close workbooks and read and write cell-ranges? Perhaps some .NET experts know a trick or two which have not yet bubbled into the Python community? What about you office-hackers? Could there be a better way to get at Excel's innards than COM?</p>

<p>In today's adventure, I've been trying to get two specific properties from the <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> in the last question to display.  Each List has specific properties, shown below:</p>

<pre>
---------------------
|     Bar Class     |
---------------------
| Id        int     |
| Foo.Id    int     |
| Name      string  |
| Type      string  |
---------------------
</pre>

<p>For display, I'd like to display the <code>Bar.Name + Bar.Type</code>, concatenated together.  Obviously I have to retain the complete object, since the Id will be passed back to be sent to the database.</p>

<p>At first, I tried <code>&lt;%#Eval(""Value.Type"" + ""Value.Name"")%&gt;</code>, clearly that did not work.  My guess now is that I need to write a foreach loop to iterate through the Dictionary Object, and retrieve the <code>Dictionary.Value</code> Objects intact, and build a dropdown list out of that. But then, the problem becomes tying that back to the associated profile, and sending it back to the database wholesale.</p>

<p>Here currently is how the page looks:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=""center""&gt; &lt;%#Eval(""Key.Name"") %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;asp:DropDownList ID=""ddlListOfBars"" runat=""server"" 
DataSource='&lt;%#Eval(""Value"")%&gt;' DataValueField=""Id"" DataTextField=""Type"" /&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I've been monkeying around with different ways of changing the <code>DataTextField</code> but haven't yet figured out a combination that works.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ol>
<li>Am I overthinking this?</li>
<li>What am I missing?</li>
<li>Is there a resource for how you would pull specific properties out of the <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> to use those values as the display Values for the <code>DropDownList</code>, and if so, is there a good resource on that topic?</li>
<li>Is this post as clear as mud?</li>

<p>When I initially set the HierarchicalData instance in the Model, it is displayed as expected:</p>

<pre><code>function buildHierarchicalData(parentItems:ArrayCollection):void
{
    __model.myHierarchicalData = new HierarchicalData();

    __model.myHierarchicalData.source = parentItems;

<p><strong>parentItems</strong> is a Collection of ParentItem valueObjects:</p>

<pre><code>package

    {
        public var children:ArrayCollection;

        public var label:String;
    }

<p>However, when I move child items from one parent to another (via drag-and-drop), the update is not visible, using this code:</p>

<pre><code>function moveChildren(movedChildren:Array /* of ParentItem */):void
{
    parentItem.children = new ArrayCollection(movedChildren);
}
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason, however, this DOES work:</p>

<pre><code>function moveChildren(movedChildren:Array /* of ParentItem */):void
{
    parentItem.children.source = movedChildren;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Why do I have to update the source of the ArrayCollection???</p>

<pre><code>Outlook.MailItem objMail = (Outlook.MailItem)olkApp.CreateItem(Outlook.OlItemType.olMailItem);
objMail.To = to;
objMail.Subject = subject;
objMail.HTMLBody = htmlBody;
</code></pre>

<p>The email is generated externally by saving from an RTF control (TX Text Control), which yields HTML with links to images stored in a <code>&lt;&lt;FileName&gt;&gt;</code>_files subdirectory. Example: </p>

<p><code>&lt;img border=""0"" src=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/ItsMe/Local%20Settings/Temp/2/zbt4dmvs_Images/zbt4dmvs_1.png"" width=""94"" height=""94"" alt=""[image]""&gt;</code></p>

<p>Sending the email this way generates a mail with broken links.  </p>

<p>Using Outlook 2007 as the email client with Word as the email editor, switching to RTF (Options tab, Format tab group) preserves the layout <em>and</em> inlines the images.</p>

<p>Programmatically doing this via:</p>

<pre><code>var oldFormat = objMail.BodyFormat;
objMail.BodyFormat = Outlook.OlBodyFormat.olFormatRichText;
objMail.BodyFormat = oldFormat;
</code></pre>

<p>loses the formatting and mangles the images (the image becomes a <code>[image]</code> link marker on screen which is clickable but no longer shows the image).  This isn't a surprise given that the documentation for <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb207134.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MailItem.BodyFormat Property</a> says ""<em>All text formatting will be lost when the <code>BodyFormat</code> property is switched from RTF to HTML and vice-versa</em>"".</p>

<p>Sadly there doesnt seem to be an easy way to change the <code>Type</code> of each <code>Attachment</code> in the <code>MailItem.Attachements</code> to <code>OlAttachmentType.olByValue</code>, as it's a read-only property that's set when you create the <code>Attachment</code>.</p>

<p>An approach that comes to mind is to walk the HTML, replacing the <code><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></code> tags with markers and programatically walking the <code>MailItem</code> text, inserting an <code>Outlook.Attachment</code> of <code>Type</code> <code>OlAttachmentType.olByValue</code>.</p>

<p>Another option is to convert the <code><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></code> links to use <code><code>src=""cid:uniqueIdN""</code></code> and add the images as attachments with the referenced identities.</p>

<p>So, to the question... Is there a way to get the linked images converted to embedded images, ideally without getting into third party tools like Redemption?  Converting to RTF happens to yield the outcome, but doing it that way is by no means a pre-requisite, and obviously may lose fidelity - I Just Want It to Just Work :D  Neither of my existing ideas sound Clean to me.</p>

<p>A while ago, I stumbled upon this 2001 DDJ article by Alexandrescu: 
<a href=""http://www.ddj.com/cpp/184403799"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.ddj.com/cpp/184403799</a></p>

<p>It's about comparing various ways to initialized a buffer to some value. Like what ""memset"" does for single-byte values. He compared various implementations (memcpy, explicit ""for"" loop, duff's device) and did not really find the best candidate across all dataset sizes and all compilers.</p>

<p>Quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a very deep, and sad, realization underlying all this. We are in 2001, the year of the Spatial Odyssey. (...) Just step out of the box and look at us — after 50 years, we're still not terribly good at filling and copying memory.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<ol>
<li>does anyone have more recent information about this problem ? Do recent GCC and Visual C++ implementations perform significantly better than 7 years ago ?

<li>I'm writing code that has a lifetime of 5+ (probably 10+) years and that will process arrays' sizes from a few bytes to hundred of megabytes. I can't assume that my choices now will still be optimal in 5 years. What should I do:
<ul>
   <li>a) use the system's memset (or equivalent) and forget about optimal performance or assume the runtime and compiler will handle this for me.
   <li>b) benchmark once and for all on various array sizes and compilers and switch at runtime between several routines.
   <li>c) run the benchmark at program initialization and switch at runtime based on accurate (?) data.
</ul>
</ol>

<p>Edit: I'm working on image processing software. My array items are PODs and every millisecond counts !</p>

<p>Edit 2: Thanks for the first answers, here are some additional informations:<ul><li>Buffer initialization may represent 20%-40% of total runtime of some algorithms. <li>The platform may vary in the next 5+ years, although it will stay in the ""fastest CPU money can buy from DELL"" category. Compilers will be some form of GCC and Visual C++. No embedded stuff or exotic architectures on the radar<li>I'd like to hear from people who had to update their software when MMX and SSE appeared, since I'll have to do the same when ""SSE2015"" becomes available... :)

<p>There is also a warning message:</p>

<p>I've currently got a sizable test suite written using Selenium RC's C# driver. Running the entire test suite takes a little over an hour to complete. I normally don't have to run the entire suite so it hasn't been a concern up to now, but it's something that I'd like to be able to do more regularly (ie, as part of an automated build)</p>

<p>I've been spending some time recently poking around with the Selenium Grid project whose purpose essentially is to allow those tests to run in parallel. Unfortunately, it seems that the TestDriven.net plugin that I'm using runs the tests serially (ie, one after another). I'm assuming that NUnit would execute the tests in a similar fashion, although I haven't actually tested this out. </p>

<p>I've noticed that the NUnit 2.5 betas are starting to talk about running tests in parallel with pNUnit, but I haven't really familiarized myself enough with the project to know for sure whether this would work. </p>

<p>Another option I'm considering is separating my test suite into different libraries which would let me run a test from each library concurrently, but I'd like to avoid that if possible since I'm not convinced this is a valid reason for splitting up the test suite.</p>

<p>Here's a few refining details:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the query is set to filter on any
of those fields (such as getting a
list of non-disabled accounts in the
Marketing department group), they
disappear from the result set (since
as far as AD is concerned, they're
missing). </p></li>
<li><p>If the query is performed
with a highly-privileged domain
admin account, the query works just
fine.</p></li>
<li><p>The records with the problem is about 1/4 - 1/3 of the total user records.  Most <em>do</em> seem to be newer records (we thought for a time that it was perhaps related to upgrading to 2003 on the domain controller server), although some older records seem affected as well.</p></li>
<li><p>A cursory look over two similar records, one whose entire record is viewable by any account, and another which isn't doesn't show any obvious differences.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So my best guess is that there's some sort of permission deny set (perhaps at the schema level?) which makes certain fields restricted. I should note that the domain administrators never knowingly set any such permissions. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE/RESOLUTION:</strong> ADSI Edit (in <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/892777"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Windows 2003 Support Tools</a>) helped me to nail it down to a change in the default permissions on the Authenticated User role.  For some people, the role contained the Read Account Restrictions (which contains userAccountControl) and Read Group Membership (memberOf), and for others it didn't.</p>

<p>The original cause of the difference still isn't clear, although the fact that most of the ""bad"" records were created <em>after</em> a switch to Windows 2003 for the Domain Controller, that could be a factor.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong>  This is still a bit undecided, but will most likely be an updated Group Policy, combined with a script to update existing accounts.</p>

<p>You have two tables on the back end: one is Components and one is Manufacturers.  Every Component has ONE Manufacturer.  Not at all an unusual, foreign key lookup-relationship.</p>

<p>I Silverlight, I access data via WCF service.  I will make a call to Components_Get(id) to get the Current component (to view or edit) and a call to Manufacturers_GetAll() to get the complete list of manufacturers to populate the possible selections for a ComboBox.  I then Bind the SelectedItem on the ComboBox to the Manufacturer for the Current Component and the ItemSource on the ComboBox to the list of possible Manufacturers.  like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;UserControl.Resources&gt;
    &lt;data:WebServiceDataManager x:Key=""WebService"" /&gt;
&lt;/UserControl.Resources&gt;
&lt;Grid DataContext={Binding Components.Current, mode=OneWay, Source={StaticResource WebService}}&gt;
    &lt;ComboBox Grid.Row=""2"" Grid.Column=""2"" Style=""{StaticResource ComboBoxStyle}"" Margin=""3""
              ItemsSource=""{Binding Manufacturers.All, Mode=OneWay, Source={StaticResource WebService}}"" 
              SelectedItem=""{Binding Manufacturer, Mode=TwoWay}""  &gt;
        &lt;ComboBox.ItemTemplate&gt;
            &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
                &lt;Grid&gt;
                    &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding Name}"" Style=""{StaticResource DefaultTextStyle}""/&gt;
                &lt;/Grid&gt;
            &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
        &lt;/ComboBox.ItemTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/ComboBox&gt;
&lt;/Grid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This worked great for the longest time, until I got clever and did a little client side caching of the Component (which I planned turn on for the Manufacturers as well).  When I turned on caching for the Component and I got a cache hit, all of the data would be there in the objects correctly, but the SelectedItem would fail to Bind.  The reason for this, is that the calls are Asynchronous in Silverlight and with the benefit of the caching, the Component is not being returned prior to the Manufacturers.  So when the SelectedItem tries to find the Components.Current.Manufacturer in the ItemsSource list, it is not there, because this list is still empty because Manufacturers.All has not loaded from the WCF service yet.  Again, if I turn off the Component caching, it works again, but it feels WRONG - like I am just getting lucky that the timing is working out. The correct fix IMHO is for MS to fix the ComboBox/ ItemsControl control to understand that this WILL happen with Asynch calls being the norm.  But until then, I need a need a way yo fix it...</p>

<p>Here are some options that I have thought of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Eliminate the caching or turn it on across the board to once again mask the problem. Not Good IMHO, because this will fail again.  Not really willing to sweep it back under the rug.</li>
<li>Create an intermediary object that would do the synchronization for me (that should be done in the ItemsControl itself).  It would accept and Item and an ItemsList and then output and ItemWithItemsList property when both have a arrived.  I would Bind the ComboBox to the resulting output so that it would never get one item before the other.  My problem is that this seems like a pain but it will make certain that the race condition does not re-occur.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any thougnts/Comments?</p>

<p>FWIW: I will post my solution here for the benefit of others.</p>

<p>@Joe:  Thanks so much for the response.  I am aware of the need to update the UI only from the UI thread.  It is my understanding and I think I have confirmed this through the debugger that in SL2, that the code generated by the the Service Reference takes care of this for you.  i.e. when I call Manufacturers_GetAll_Asynch(), I get the Result through the Manufacturers_GetAll_Completed event. If you look inside the Service Reference code that is generated, it ensures that the *Completed event handler is called from the UI thread. My problem is not this, it is that I make two different calls (one for the manufacturers list and one for the component that references an id of a manufacturer) and then Bind both of these results to a single ComboBox.  They both Bind on the UI thread, the problem is that if the list does not get there before the selection, the selection is ignored.</p>

<p>Also note that this is still a problem <a href=""http://brantob.wordpress.com/2008/10/09/silverlight-2-combo-box-binding-sublety/"" rel=""noreferrer"">if you just set the ItemSource and the SelectedItem in the wrong order</a>!!! </p>

<p>Another Update:
While there is still the combobox race condition, I discovered something else interesting.  You should <strong>NEVER</strong> genrate a PropertyChanged event from within the ""getter"" for that property.  Example: in my SL data object of type ManufacturerData, I have a property called ""All"".  In the Get{} it checks to see if it has been loaded, if not it loads it like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class ManufacturersData : DataServiceAccessbase
{
    public ObservableCollection&lt;Web.Manufacturer&gt; All
    {
        get
        {
            if (!AllLoaded)
                LoadAllManufacturersAsync();
            return mAll;
        }
        private set
        {
            mAll = value;
            OnPropertyChanged(""All"");
        }
    }

    private void LoadAllManufacturersAsync()
    {
        if (!mCurrentlyLoadingAll)
        {
            mCurrentlyLoadingAll = true;

            // check to see if this component is loaded in local Isolated Storage, if not get it from the webservice
            ObservableCollection&lt;Web.Manufacturer&gt; all = IsoStorageManager.GetDataTransferObjectFromCache&lt;ObservableCollection&lt;Web.Manufacturer&gt;&gt;(mAllManufacturersIsoStoreFilename);
            if (null != all)
            {
                UpdateAll(all);
                mCurrentlyLoadingAll = false;
            }
            else
            {
                Web.SystemBuilderClient sbc = GetSystemBuilderClient();
                sbc.Manufacturers_GetAllCompleted += new EventHandler&lt;hookitupright.com.silverlight.data.Web.Manufacturers_GetAllCompletedEventArgs&gt;(sbc_Manufacturers_GetAllCompleted);
                sbc.Manufacturers_GetAllAsync(); ;
            }
        }
    }
    private void UpdateAll(ObservableCollection&lt;Web.Manufacturer&gt; all)
    {
       All = all;
       AllLoaded = true;
    }
    private void sbc_Manufacturers_GetAllCompleted(object sender, hookitupright.com.silverlight.data.Web.Manufacturers_GetAllCompletedEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.Error == null)
        {
            UpdateAll(e.Result.Records);
            IsoStorageManager.CacheDataTransferObject&lt;ObservableCollection&lt;Web.Manufacturer&gt;&gt;(e.Result.Records, mAllManufacturersIsoStoreFilename);
        }
        else
            OnWebServiceError(e.Error);
        mCurrentlyLoadingAll = false;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this code <strong>FAILS</strong> on a ""cache hit"" because it will generate an PropertyChanged event for ""All"" from within the All { Get {}} method which would normally cause the Binding System to call All {get{}} again...I copied this pattern of creating bindable silverlight data objects from a ScottGu blog posting way back and it has served me well overall, but stuff like this makes it pretty tricky.  Luckily the fix is simple.  Hope this helps someone else.</p>

<p>Features that are important to us:</p>

<ul>
<li>document sharing (specifications, manuals etc.)</li>
<li>discussion forums (I hate when important information is lost in the inbox)</li>
<li>issue tracking</li>
<li>Subversion integration would be nice to have but probably neither SharePoint, nor activeCollab currently support it, do they?</li>
</ul>

<p>Other things like time tracking are less important to us (although nice to have).</p>

<p>When I compare the two solutions, I see these strong points and drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Killer feature of SharePoint is Office integration. For instance, specification is much better authored in MS Word with styles, image drag&amp;drop etc. compared to a plain HTML textarea and some plain text format. We also use Outlook quite extensively so it would be good if we could leverage this tool.</li>
<li>activeCollab is web based and has a slick user interface which is important for adoption in our company (if our devs don't find the solution easy to work with, they will not use it). My boss also kind of likes easy solutions and activeCollab wins easily in this area.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding price, activeCollab is something like few hundreds dollars (reasonable one time cost) but I'm not too sure about SharePoint. If I'm right, the basic ""SharePoint Services"" version would be enough for us (I don't think we need the full MS Office SharePoint Server) and in that case, we need only Windows Server licence (which we already) and a SQL Server licence (would SQL Server Express work? or do we need at least workgroup edition?). This means that even SharePoint doesn't need to be too expensive if we go for the lowest edition.</p>

<p>Is there anyone who did the same comparison and could possibly provide more insight?</p>

<p>Thanks to the answers from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/581837/wpf-getting-new-coordinates-after-a-rotation"">this post</a>, I am now able to find the x-y coordinates of all the points of the rectangles (even when rotated), and Collision-Detection with Walls is almost working perfectly now.</p>

<p>Now I need to implement collision detection with the bots themselves (cause obviously, there will be more than one bot in the Arena).</p>

<p>Square-Square Collision Detection (Non-rotated) is not valid in this case because the bots will be turned at an angle (just like I described <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/581837/wpf-getting-new-coordinates-after-a-rotation"">here</a>).</p>

<p><strong>So what is the best way to implement this form of Rotated Rectangles Collision Detection in WPF?</strong></p>

<p>I guess there must be some math involved, but usually it turns out that there are functions in WPF that ""calculate"" these maths for you (just like in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/581837/wpf-getting-new-coordinates-after-a-rotation"">this case</a>)</p>

When I fire up Thunderbird the next morning, the <code>STAT</code> command should show 20 messages.  However, Thunderbird should not download the first 10 messages; it should start at message 11 (or the unique identifier or UID for message 11).  Thunderbird will send a POP3 <code>UIDL</code> command, then compare the UID's to the UID of the last message Thunderbird retrieved yesterday.

<p>Consider this code:</p>

<pre><code>HMACSHA1 hashSha = new HMACSHA1(_validationKey);
byte[] ret = hashSha.ComputeHash(bytes, offSet, count);
return ret;
</code></pre>

<p>We are generating a new _validationkey, right? Then we take our bytes and hash them in ComputeHash. What is the point of the _validationKey? Do we need it when we validate the hash in some way?</p>

<p>And if it doesn't have any role in the process, then is the following true? </p>

<p>I have a byte array that's 80 bytes long, and the last 20 bytes consists of an asp.net sha1 hash, then the first 60 bytes, if sha1 hashed should match the last 20</p>

<p>validationKey plays no role in that?</p>

<p>To be more specific, I'm writing application which runs across many computers and sends/receives data from one to another. I feel more comfortable to have separate thread for each connected machine and task, like 1) sending data, 2) receiving data, 3) reestablishing connection when it is dropped. So, given that there are N nodes in cluster, each machine is going to have 3 threads for each of N-1 neighbours. Typically there will be 12 machines, which comes to 33 communication threads.</p>

<p>Most of those threads will be sleeping most of the time, so for optimization purposes I could reduce number of threads and give more job to each of them. Like, for example. reestablishing connection is responsibility of receiving thread. Or sending to all connected machines is done by single thread.</p>

<p>So is there any significant perfomance impact on having many sleeping threads?</p>

<p>Here is the situation:
I have a block of SQL commands coming as plain text. It might be one SQL commands or several. I need a way to split multiple SQL commands so I can run them one at a time. Microsoft SQL Management Studio does has this behavior out of box.</p>

<p>Some important points:</p>

<li>I really do need to run them one at a time. Seriously.</li>
<li>I don't want to require the user to enter a semi-colon after each SQL statement.</li>
<li>SQL statements can be on one or multiple lines, so I can't wrap on LBs/CRs</li>
<li>It needs to support SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE at least.</li>
<li>It needs to support queries that are sub-selects</li>
<li>Neatly tabbed SQL needs to work</li>
<li>(In the interest of usable software) I do not want to force the user to enter in any kind of delimiter.</li>

Hibernate needs to set the accessibility of the field to true before it tries to read it which I can see having some <em>slight</em> overhead.  However wouldn't that be done at the Class-level in the scope of a Session or perhaps only once when the Configuration is read and SessionFactory is built?</p>

<p>In the above example, I'd like the <code>print</code> statement to be executed only if <code>i</code> is empty. However, as <code>else</code> only respects <code>break</code> and <code>return</code>, it is always executed, regardless of the length of <code>i</code>.</p>

<p>If it's impossible to use <code>for...else</code> in this way, what's the best approach to this so that the <code>print</code> statement is only executed when nothing is yielded?</p>

We've often had to do a <code>make clean ; make</code> for our changes to actually be reflected in the recompilation, so I don't want to rely on these Makefiles.</p>

server.register_instance(service)

<p>I then have a ServiceRemote class that looks like this:</p>

<p>So all calls on the ServiceRemote object will be forwarded to xmlrpclib.Server, which then forwards it to the remote server. The problem is a method in the service that takes named varargs:</p>

<pre><code>@useDb
def select(self, db, fields, **kwargs):
    pass

<p>The @useDb decorator wraps the function, creating the db before the call and opening it, then closing it after the call is done before returning the result.</p>

<p>When I call this method, I get the error ""<strong>call</strong>() got an unexpected keyword argument 'name'"". So, is it possible to call methods taking variable named arguments remotely? Or will I have to create an override for each method variation I need.</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses. I changed my code around a bit so the question is no longer an issue. However now I know this for future reference if I indeed do need to implement positional arguments and support remote invocation. I think a combination of Thomas and praptaks approaches would be good. Turning kwargs into positional args on the client through xmlrpclient, and having a wrapper on methods serverside to unpack positional arguments.</p>

<p>One possible way to do it is to make all the necessary class methods to be <code>virtual</code> (so that DLL linker will not need these methods' definitions). The disadvantages of this approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>I cannot create objects of exported classes
in DLL code using <code>new</code> (a have to
create additional functions in
executable's code). </li>
<li>I have to make all these methods <code>virtual</code>,

</ol>

<p>There is a way to export a class from a DLL to an executable using Microsoft's <code>__declspec(dllexport)</code> storage-class extended attribute.
Is there a way to export a class from executable to DLL using the same technique?</p>

<p>My old Borland C 6 compiler does not allow me to create import library during the build of executable project. (So, when compiling the DLL, linker gives me unresolved external error messages for all imported non-virtual class methods.) Is it a limitation of this very compiler, or maybe I'm missing something important?</p>

In the code, it first gets a copy of the live CPU registers (via RtlCaptureContext()), then uses a few ""<code>#ifdef ...</code>"" blocks to save the CPU-specific register names into <code>stackframe.AddrPC.Offset</code>, ...<code>AddrStack</code>..., and ...<code>AddrFrame</code>...; also, for each of the 3 <code>Addr</code>... members above, it sets <code>stackframe.Addr</code>...<code>.Mode = AddrModeFlat</code>. (This was borrowed from some example code I came across a while back.)</p>

<p>With an x86 binary, this works great.  With an x64 binary, though, StackWalk64() passes back bogus addresses.  <i>(The first time the API is called, the only blatantly bogus address value appears in <code>AddrReturn</code> ( == <code>0xFFFFFFFF'FFFFFFFE</code> -- aka StackWalk64()'s 3rd arg, the pseudo-handle returned by GetCurrentThread()).  If the API is called a second time, however, all <code>Addr</code>... variables receive bogus addresses.)</i>  This happens regardless of how <code>AddrFrame</code> is set:</p>

<ul>
<li>using either of the recommended x64 ""base/frame pointer"" CPU registers: <code>rbp</code> (= <code>0xf</code>), or <code>rdi</code> (= <code>0x0</code>)</li>
<li>using <code>rsp</code> <i>(didn't expect it to work, but tried it anyway)</i></li>
<li>setting <code>AddrPC</code> and <code>AddrStack</code> normally, but leaving <code>AddrFrame</code> zeroed out <i>(seen in other example code)</i></li>
<li>zeroing out all <code>Addr</code>... values, to let StackWalk64() fill them in from the passed-in CPU-register context <i>(seen in other example code)</i></li>
</ul>

<p>FWIW, the physical stack buffer's contents are also different on x64 vs. x86 (after accounting for different pointer widths &amp; stack buffer locations, of course).  Regardless of the reason, StackWalk64() should still be able to walk the call stack correctly -- heck, the debugger is still able to walk the call stack, and it appears to use StackWalk64() itself behind the scenes.  The oddity there is that the (correct) call stack reported by the debugger contains base-address &amp; return-address pointer values whose constituent bytes don't actually exist in the stack buffer (below or above the current stack pointer).</p>

<p><i>(FWIW #2: Given the stack-buffer strangeness above, I did try disabling ASLR (<code>/dynamicbase:no</code>) to see if it made a difference, but the binary still exhibited the same behavior.)</i></p>

<p>So.  Any ideas why this would work fine on x86, but have problems on x64?  Any suggestions on how to fix it?</p>

</ul>

<p>and other sites say it does.</p>

<p>The reason I'm asking is we are flattening our WCF wsdl with a custom endpoint behavior extension (an implementation of IWsdlExportExtension/IEndpointBehavior) and using the flattened wsdl via Visual Studio 2008's Add Reference gives us compile errors as it is duplicating Types/Classes.  The reference is added without any errors.  SvcUtil, on the other hand, throws the duplicate class into a seperate namespace which fixes the build issue.</p>

<p>So SvcUtil works, but Visual Studio 2008 doesn't on some of our flatten wsdls.  We are fine with continueing to use svcutil if the Add Service Reference in Visual Studio doesn't work, but are wondering if anyone knows if there are any implications in doing so.  I couldn't find any evidence that we ""shouldn't"" be using svcutil, just that it isn't as easy as using the Add Service Reference in Visual Studio 2008.</p>

The obvious way to do this is to use something like <code>select()</code>, but the only thing I can find in Java that does that is <code>Selector.select()</code>, which takes a <code>Channel</code>. It doesn't appear to be possible to get a <code>Channel</code> from an <code>InputStream</code> or <code>OutputStream</code> (<code>FileStream</code> has a  <code>getChannel()</code> method but that doesn't help here)</p>

<p>So, instead I wrote some code to poll all the streams:</p>

<pre><code>while( !out_eof || !err_eof )
{
    while( out_str.available() )
    {
        if( (bytes = out_str.read(buf)) != -1 )
        {
            // Do something with output stream
        }
        else
            out_eof = true;
    }
    while( err_str.available() )
    {
        if( (bytes = err_str.read(buf)) != -1 )
        {
            // Do something with error stream
        }
        else
            err_eof = true;
    }
    sleep(100);
}
</code></pre>

<p>which works, except that it never terminates. When one of the streams reaches end of file, <code>available()</code> returns zero so <code>read()</code> isn't called and we never get the -1 return that would indicate EOF.</p>

<p>One solution would be a non-blocking way to detect EOF. I can't see one in the docs anywhere. Alternatively is there a better way of doing what I want to do?</p>

<p>I see this question here:

and although it doesn't exactly do what I want, I can probably use that idea, of spawning separate threads for each stream, for the particular problem I have now. But surely that isn't the only way to do it? Surely there must be a way to read from multiple streams without using a thread for each?</p>

Javed Hasan started arguing with him about his solution to the nolock situation on a high volume site.</p>

<p>Here, the problem trying to solve is, from the sql sense we need to use Select statements with NOLOCK or use SET TRANSACTION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED, otherwise at high volume rows in DB will be locked and cause errors.  The technology Omar used is Linq2Sql, so the question is how do we get this achieved in your C# data access code so the above does not happen?</p>

<p>Basically in the post, Omar comes to his solution by working and testing on real world site and with tools like SqlProfiler, whereas Javed Hasan comes to his solution with MSDN documents and Scott Hanselman's blog post etc.</p>

<p>Omar suggests using the following</p>

<pre><code>using (var db = new DropthingsDataContext2())
{
  db.Connection.Open();
  db.ExecuteCommand(""SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;"");

  var user = db.aspnet_Users.First();
  var pages = user.Pages.ToList();
}
</code></pre>

<p>whereas Javed Hasan suggests</p>

<pre><code>using (new TransactionScope(TransactionScopeOption.Required, 
  new TransactionOptions { IsolationLevel = IsolationLevel.ReadUncommitted }))
{
 //Your db Operation
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>I'm very interested to know what you guys out there do on this particular issue on a high volume site like the StatckOverflow, or what did Jeff and their guys do in this regard?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: After reading the first post, I want to point out a few things in Omar's post.</p>

<ol>
<li>he did run into connection problem with his approach but he solved it, see his post.</li>
<li>more importantly he mentioned he tried the using ADO.NET Transaction way and even tried what Scott Hanselman wrote on his blog, but it is not working for high volume site, it degrades the performance quite a bit.  Omar said this ""System.Transactions has significant overhead. I have never been able to use it on a high volume website without making CPU go 100% and Req/sec come down to 1/10th. It's made for enterprise applications, not for high volume websites.""</li>

When I tap Edit, move a row, tap Done, then tap the row, the built-in <code>UILabel</code> turns completely white (text and background) and opaque, and the blue shade to the cell doesn't show behind it.  What gives?  Is there something I should be doing that I'm not?  I have a hacky fix, but I want the real McCoy.</p>

<p>Here is how to reproduce it:</p>

<p>Starting with the standard ""Navigation-Based Application"" template in the iPhone OS 2.2.1 SDK:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open RootViewController.m</p></li>
<li><p>Uncomment <code>viewDidLoad</code>, and enable the Edit button:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Uncomment the following line to display an Edit button in the navigation bar for this view controller.
    self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = self.editButtonItem;
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Specify that the table has a few cells:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section {
    return 4;
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>In <code>tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code>, add a line to set the text property of a cell, and therefore to use the built-in UILabel subview:</p>

<pre><code>// Set up the cell...
cell.text = @""Test"";
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>To enable reordering, uncomment <code>tableView:moveRowAtIndexPath:toIndexPath:</code>.  The default implementation is blank, which is fine in this case since the template doesn't include a data model.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure the project for the Simulator, OS 2.2.1, Build and Go.  When the app comes up, tap Edit, then slide any row to a new position, tap Done, and then tap each row one at a time.  Usually a tap will select a row, turn it blue, and turn its text white.  But a tap on the row that you just moved does that <em>and</em> leaves the UILabel's background color as white.  The result is a confusing white open space with blue strips on the edges.  Oddly enough, after the first bogus tap, another tap appears to correct the problem.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So far I have found a hack that fixes it, but I'm not happy with it.  It works by ensuring that the built-in <code>UILabel</code> is non-opaque and that it has no background color, immediately upon selection.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
    // hacky bugfix: when a row is reordered and then selected, the UILabel displays all crappy
    UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath];
    for (UIView *view in cell.contentView.subviews) {
        if ([[view class] isSubclassOfClass:[UILabel class]]) {
            ((UILabel *) view).backgroundColor = nil;
            view.opaque = NO;
        }
    }

    // regular stuff: only flash the selection, don't leave it blue forever
    [tableView deselectRowAtIndexPath:indexPath animated:YES];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This appears to work, but I don't expect it to be a good idea forever.  What is the Right Way to fix this?</p>

<p>I've found that the tests are very brittle, broken not just by code changes that actually change the pages but also by innocuous refactorings such as renaming a control (since I need to pass the control's clientID to Selenium's Click method, etc) or replacing a gridview with a repeater. As a result I find myself ""wasting"" time updating string values in my test cases in order to fix broken tests.</p>

<p>Is there a way to write more maintainable Selenium tests? Or a better web UI testing tool?</p>

<p><b>Edited to add:</b>
Generally the first draft is created by recording a test in the IDE. (This first step may be performed by QA staff.)  Then I refactor the generated C# code (extract constants, extract methods for repeated code, maybe repeat the test case with different data, etc). But the general flow of code for each test case remains reasonably close to the originally generated code.</p>

<p>I'm sure many of you have been faced by the challenge of localizing a database backend to an application. If you've not then I'd be pretty confident in saying that the odds of you having to do so in the future is quite large. I'm talking anout storing multiple translations of texts (and the same can be said for currency etc.) for your database entities.</p>

<p>For example the classic ""Category"" table might have a Name and a Description column which should be globalized. One way would be to do have a ""Text"" table for each of your entities and then do a join to retreive the values based on the provided language.</p>

<p>This leaves you with a lot of ""Text"" tables, one for each entity which you want to localize, with the addition of a TextType to distinguish between the various texts that it may store.</p>

<p>I'm curious if there are any, documented, best-practises / design patterns on implementing this kind of support into a SQL Server 2005/2008 datebase (I'm being specific about the RDBMS since it might contain supported keywords and such which helps with the implementation)?</p>

<h2>Thoughts on XML approach</h2>

<p>One idea I have been toying with (albeit only in my head so far) was to leverage the XML datatype introduced in SQL Server 2005. The idea was to make columns which should support localization, of the XML datatype (and bind a schema to it). The XML would contain the localized strings along with the language code / culture it was tied to.</p>

<p>Something along the lines of</p>

<pre><code>Product
ID (int, identity)
Name (XML ...)
Description (XML ...)
</code></pre>

<p>Then you would have something like this as the XML</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *

Where Product.ID = 10

<p>And you would get back the product with all localized texts which would mean you would have to do the extraction on the client-side. The biggest problem here is obviously the amount of extra data that you would have to return on each query, The benefits would be a cleaner design with no look-up tables, joins and so on. </p>

<p>Btw, what ever method I do end up using in my design I will still be using Linq To SQL (.NET Platform) to query the database (the XML approach should be a problem since it would return an XElement which could be interpreted client-side)</p>

<p>So suggestion on database localization design patterns, and possibly comments on the XML thought, would be very apprechiated.</p>

Currently the filter is invoked when the user selects a link on a given page.</p>

<p>Here is what I came up with:</p>

<p>The above is what I have doFilter().</p>

<pre><code>String fileName = ""fileName.xls"";

HttpServletRequest httpRequest = (HttpServletRequest) pRequest;
String requestURI = httpRequest.getRequestURI();

if(StringUtils.isNotBlank(requestURI))
{
  String uri[] = StringUtils.split(requestURI, '/');
  fileName = uri[uri.length - 1];
}

HttpServletResponse httpResponse = (HttpServletResponse) pResponse;
httpResponse.setContentType(""application/vnd.ms-excel"");
httpResponse.setHeader(""Content-disposition"", ""attachment; filename=\"""" + fileName +""\"""");

    &lt;url-pattern&gt;*.xls&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/filter-mapping&gt;

<p>This all is working on my development box:  Windows XP, JBoss, Eclipse, Oracle.  But when it runs on the test server—Linux, Apache/JBoss, Oracle—it does not work.  It appears that the filter is not even being called, no errors thrown, etc.  Any idea as to why this would happen?</p>

<p>My trouble is not so much with the setNumberStyle:NSNumberFormatterCurrencyStyle and displaying floats as currency. The trouble is more with how said numberFormatter works with this UITextField. I can find few examples. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/276382/best-way-to-enter-numeric-values-with-decimal-points"">This thread</a> from November and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/317311/obtaining-an-nsdecimalnumber-from-a-locale-specific-string"">this one</a> give me some ideas but leaves me with more questions.</p>

<p>I am using the UIKeyboardTypeNumberPad keyboard and understand that I should probably show $0.00 (or whatever local currency format is) in the field upon display then as a user enters numerals to shift the decimal place along:</p>

<ul>
<li>Begin with display $0.00</li>
<li>Tap 2 key: display $0.02 </li>
<li>Tap 5 key: display $0.25</li>
<li>Tap 4 key: display $2.54</li>
<li>Tap 3 key: display $25.43</li>
</ul>

<p>Then [numberFormatter numberFromString:textField.text] should give me a value I can store in my NSNumber variable. </p>

<p>Sadly I'm still struggling: Is this <em>really</em> the best/easiest way? If so then maybe someone can help me with the implementation?

and I intend to run the test on c code under Linux. </p>

<p>Now check and some well designed code and some test code can help me to verify 
that the basic functionality is correct, 
I mean it is quite easy to just look at the variables in and response back and then 
decide if a function is correct or not.</p>

<p>But let's say I want to test a dynamic memory structure with a lot off malloc and free, 
and it turns out that I can put data in and get correct data back out again.
But that does not prove that I have not broken some memory in the process, 
let's say I forgot to free half off the memory and lost the pointers (a classical memleak).
That code would probably pass most of the unit testing.</p>

<p>So now for the question: 
is it a good idea to run the entire unit test code with i.e. Valgrind and let him 
detect any malloc/free problems? (Or maybe compile in something like Electric Fence?)</p>

<p>It feels like a good idea, but I'm not sure what I'm getting myself into here.....</p>

<p>Thanks 
Johan</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Update:</em> Thanks Douglas and Jonathan, 
it seems like this is a good idea and something I should continue with :-)</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Valgrind is a fun tool, however the first memleaks I found doing this 
was in the test framework and not my own code (quite funny though).
So a tip to the rest out there is to verify that the unit test framework that you are using is not leaking, before turning your own code upside down.
An empty test case was all that was needed in my case, 
since then nothing but the unit test framework is running.</p>

A couple of the tests keep failing with that NameNotFoundException only when the jndi name is ""complex"".</p>

<p>This is a stand alone app and is not running with any web containers.  The app uses a preference file and there is no LDAP involved.  The environment is Java v1.4, and the app is installed with all the necessary libraries local to it.  (lib dir with jndi.jar, jms.jar ... etc).  Simple, right ?</p>

<p>Due to the complexity of the library and how it futzes around with lots of objects, I have a simple test and then ramp up the complexity adding in each piece as a separate test.</p>

<p>Setup:
File: c:\data\eclipse\workspace\APP\testfiles\jndi\jms\label\.bindings 
<br>In file there is this entry: QReply/FactoryName=com.ibm.mq.jms.MQQueueFactory</p>

<p>UnitTest Class:
""simple"" test has</p>

<pre><code>Hashtable ht = new Hashtable();
ht.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, 
    ""file:/data/eclipse/workspace/APP/testFiles/jndi/jms/label/"");
ht.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, 
    ""com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory"");
ht.put(Context.SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION, ""none"");
Context ctx;
try {
  ctx = new InitialContext(ht);
  String jndiName = ""QReply"";
  logger.debug(""testFindRemoteObject_Simple"", 
       ""Invoking InitialContext.lookup(\"""" + jndiName + ""\"")"");
  Object remoteObject = ctx.lookup(jndiName);
  assertTrue(remoteObject != null);
} catch (NamingException e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
  fail(e.getMessage());
}
</code></pre>

<p>This passes.  Because I was having so much trouble with the library I created another test that matches the actual data passed in; the Provider URL is shortened and the jndi name picks up a ""path"".</p>

<p>""Actual"" data unit test:</p>

<pre><code>final Hashtable ht = new Hashtable();
ht.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, 
   ""file:/data/eclipse/workspace/APP/testFiles/jndi/"");
ht.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, 
   ""com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory"");
ht.put(Context.SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION, ""none"");
Context ctx;
try {
  ctx = new InitialContext(ht);
  String jndiName = ""jms/label/QReply"";
  logger.debug(""testFindRemoteObject_Actual"", 
           ""Invoking InitialContext.lookup(\"""" + jndiName + ""\"")"");
  Object remoteObject = ctx.lookup(jndiName);
  assertTrue(remoteObject != null);
} catch (NamingException e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
  fail(e.getMessage());
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which fails with </p>

<pre><code>javax.naming.NameNotFoundException: jms/label/QReply
at com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContext.getObjectFromBindings(
      RefFSContext.java:400)

           UnitTestServiceLocator.java:85)
</code></pre>

<p>where UnitTestServiceLocator.java:85 is the line of ctx.lookup(jndiname);</p>

<p>Why would the simple test pass but the more complex test fail ?  Both use a classpath that points to the lib directory which is populated with the jms and mq jars (among other things).</p>

<p>The complex test matches what the library will fill in but using magic as the passed in values.  The library code has a ""few"" more lines that extract the magic values from the preferences file(s).
What am I missing?  The library code will work on the server but fail on my laptop (when developing).</p>

<p>I even created another jndi path - just in case the first test was mucking up the second.  Still fails.</p>

<p>Since I don't have any desire (or permission to change the library code), the call to InitialContext(X); is that way BECAUSE that's the way the library does it.  I've seen the other examples with nothing passed with InitialContext and I'm confused why that is better.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
I've created a jndi_test project on linux java1.5 and that successfully runs the failing test.  Taking the same source and moving it to the windows environment - the test fails.  There are a few changes to the classpath due to the fact that there is no C drive on linux but the data files are the same.  (hmm delimiter issue ?)</p>

<p>I've also found out that I've got problems with that library IF i'm going to run it on 1.5, but that's a side issue.</p>

<ul>
<li>.NET development using Visual Studio 2005/2008</li>
<li>TortoiseSVN client</li>
</ul>

<p>I've only primarily worked with Visual Source Safe and SourceGear Vault source control systems.  In each, I map the root of the repository to a local working directory.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>$/  --&gt;  C:\source
</code></pre>

<p>As long as the local directory exists, I've got my ""working copy"" (svn) or ""working folder"" (VSS) set up.</p>

<p>To work on a new project that is already in the source code repository I need to ""get the latest"" (VSS) version of that project's directory.</p>

<p>When I go into any child directory in the repository and ""Get Latest"" (i.e. svn checkout) the client will automatically create the complete directory hierarchy for me, mirroring the structure on my local disk.  Thus when I get latest of</p>

<pre><code>$/foo/bar/project1
</code></pre>

<p>it is created on the drive at</p>

<pre><code>C:\source\foo\bar\project1
</code></pre>

<p>In subversion, when I check out a directory, I must specify the working copy directory location.  If I want to properly mirror my working copy directory structure to match the repository I have to either manually construct every child directory in the path or do a checkout of the repository root to the working copy root, getting everything in the repository.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to get a repository directory down in the hierarchy such that it will be created in a matching local working copy directory structure without all the manual intervention?</strong></p>

<p>This isn't a problem with a small repository, but in most cases, I don't need a large percentage of the source repository.

"518917","1","521646","","2009-02-06 02:51:45","","3","5473","<p>First and foremost, I apologize for any vagueness in this question.  At this point, I'm simply  trying to get some new ideas of things to try in order to diagnose this bug.</p>

<p>Anyway, the problem I'm having is with an application that's using a custom moduleloader.  That moduleloader has been compiled into an swc and the moduleloader is being instantiated via its namespace.  This all works perfectly fine.  The problem I'm encountering is specific to mx:button controls used within modules.  For whatever reason, their labels are being truncated so, for example, Sign In is showing up with an ellipsis, as Sign ...</p>

<p>After quite a bit of fooling around I have been able to establish the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>This problem only seems to occur within modules.  If a button control is used in the main mxml, the label does not get truncated.</li>
<li>The button control whose label is being truncated does not have a width specified (setting its width to 100%  or a specific pixel width doesn't fix the issue)</li>
<li>The button control is using the default padding (messing with the padding by setting left and right to 5 or any other value doesn't help matters either).</li>
<li>We are not using any embedded fonts so I've ruled that out as a possibility as well.</li>
<li>mx:CheckBox and mx:LinkButton are equally impacted by this problem although mx:CheckBox also seems to not want to show its checkbox, it just shows the truncated label.</li>
</ol>

<p>A potential side affect of this is that attaching a dataprovider to mx:ComboBox causes the combobox control to throw a drawing error but I'm not entirely certain that it's related to the above problem.</p>

<p>One interesting thing I did find while perusing the net for an answer was a mention of fontContext and its relationship to IFlexModuleFactory.  There's no specification for fontContext within our implementation of moduleloader so I'm not entirely certain if this could be the issue.  In any case, if anyone has any ideas, it would be hugely appreciated.  On the other hand, if you know exactly what ails me and can provide me with an answer, I might just wet myself with excitement.  It's late. I'm tired. I NEED my Flex app to play nice.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>--Anne</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  To clarify what I'm looking for with this question, I really just need to know the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Could this issue be caused by a namespace conflict?</li>
<li>What else can potentially override the default behavior of labels if no CSS has been implemented?</li>
<li>Has anyone encountered a problem with inheritance being lost while using a custom implementation of moduleloader?</li>
<li>Has anyone encountered this problem or a similar problem with or without using moduleloader?</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not sharing any code with this question simply because I'd have to share the entire application and, unfortunately, I can't do that.  Again, I'm not looking for the end all, be all solution, just some suggestions of things to look out for if anyone has any ideas.</p>

However, <a href=""http://www.iceincusa.com/16csp/content/16_smoke/smkrgt.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a> by Ron Morrison and Grady Booch makes me think differently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The desired strategy would be to bring each unit in one at a time, perform an extensive regression test, correct any defects and then proceed to the next unit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same document also says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As soon as a small number of units are added, a test version is generated and ""smoke tested,"" wherein a small number of tests are run to gain confidence that the integrated product will function as expected. The intent is neither to thoroughly test the new unit(s) nor to completely regression test the overall system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When describing smoke testing, the authors say this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is also important that the Smoke Test perform a quick check of the entire system, not just the new component(s).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've never seen ""extensive"" and ""regression test"" used together nor a regression test described as ""completely regression test the overall system"". Regression tests are supposed to be as light and quick as possible. And the definition of smoke test is what I learned a regression test was.</p>

<p>Did I misunderstand what I was taught? Was I taught incorrectly? Or are there multiple interpretations of ""regression test""?</p>

However, this will mean changing a method to always accept a ref parameter when I only need the functionality provided by a ref parameter 5% of the time.</p>

<p>This makes me think ""whoa, crazy, must find another way"". Am I being stupid? What sort of problems can be caused by a ref parameter?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Further details were requested, I don't think they are entirely relevant to what I was asking but here we go.</p>

<p>I'm wanting to either save a new instance (which will update with the ID which may later be used) or retrieve an existing instance that matches some logic and update that, save it then change the reference of the new instance to point to the existing one.</p>

<p>Code may make it clearer:</p>

<pre><code>protected override void BeforeSave(Log entity)
{
    var newLog = entity;

    var existingLog = (from log in repository.All()
                           where log.Stuff == newLog.Stuff 
                                 &amp;&amp; log.Id != newLog.Id
                           select log).SingleOrDefault();

    if (existingLog != null)
    {
        // update the time
        existingLog.SomeValue = entity.SomeValue;
        // remove the reference to the new entity
        entity = existingLog;
    }
}

// called from base class which usually does nothing before save
public void Save(TEntity entity)
{
    var report = validator.Validate(entity);

    if (report.ValidationPassed)
    {
        BeforeSave(entity);
        repository.Save(entity);
    }
    else
    {
        throw new ValidationException { Report = report };
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's the fact that I would be adding it in only for one child (so far) of the base class that prevents me using an overload (due to the fact I would have to duplicate the Save method). I also have the problem whereby I need to force them to use the ref version in this instance otherwise things won't work as expected.</p>

This is one of my most-visited questions, and yet I still haven't really found a satisfactory solution for my project. One idea I read in an answer to another question is to create a tool which can build solutions 'on the fly' for projects that you pick from a list. I have yet to try that though.</p>

<hr>

<p>How do you structure a very large application?</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple smallish projects/assemblies in one big solution? </li>
<li>A few big projects?</li>
<li>One solution per project?</li>
</ul>

<p>And how do you manage dependencies in the case where you don't have one solution.
Note: I'm looking for advice based on experience, not answers you found on Google (I can do that myself).</p>

<p>I'm currently working on an application which has upward of 80 dlls, each in its own solution. Managing the dependencies is almost a full time job. There is a custom in-house 'source control' with added functionality for copying dependency dlls all over the place. Seems like a sub-optimum solution to me, but is there a better way? Working on a solution with 80 projects would be pretty rough in practice, I fear.</p>

<p>(Context: winforms, not web)</p>

<p>EDIT: <em>(If you think this is a different question, leave me a comment)</em></p>

<p>It seems to me that there are interdependencies between:</p>

<ul>
<li>Project/Solution structure for an application</li>
<li>Folder/File structure</li>
<li>Branch structure for source control (if you use branching)</li>
</ul>

<p>But I have great difficulty separating these out to consider them individually, if that is even possible.</p>

<p>Let's start by saying that I know that you can step over with F8, and that you can run to a certain line with f4.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>function TMyClass.DoStuff():Integer;
begin
  // do some stuff
  bla();
end;

procedure TMyClass.Foo()
begin
  if DoStuff()=0 then // press F7 when entering this line

<p>Example: I want to step into method DoStuff() by pressing F7, but instead of going there, I first end up in FastMM4.FastGetMem(), which is a massive blob of assembly code that obviously I'm not interested in at the moment.</p>

<p>There are several ways to go about this, and I don't like any of them:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add a breakpoint on ""<em>bla</em>"" (almost useless if you only want to step into DoStuff on special occasions, like iteration 23498938);</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of pressing F7, manually move the cursor to ""<em>bla</em>"", and press F4 (Works for this simple example. In practice, it doesn't); </p></li>
<li><p>In case of FastMM: temporarily disable fastmm;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Is there any way to hint the IDE that I'm <strong>never</strong> interested into stepping into a certain block of code, or do I always have to set extra breakpoints or use F4 to try to avoid this?</p>

<p>I'm hoping for some magic compiler directive like {$NODEBUG BEGIN/END} or something like that.</p>

<p>In most cases being able to exclude entire units would be fine-grained enough for me, but being able to avoid certain methods or even lines of code would be even better.</p>

We would like to share this stack with another web application, to avoid having multiple instances of the same objects.</p>

<p>We have looked into several approaches; exposing the objects using JMX or JNDI, or using EJB3. </p>

<p>The different approaches all have their issues, and we are looking for a lightweight method. </p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to solve this?</p>

<p>Edit: I have received comments requesting me to elaborate a bit, so here goes:</p>

<p>The main problem we want to solve is that we want to have only one instance of Hibernate. This is due to problems with invalidation of Hibernate's 2nd level cache when running several client applications working with the same datasource. Also, the business/DAO/Hibernate stack is growing rather large, so not duplicating it just makes more sense.</p>

<p>First, we tried to look at how the business layer alone could be exposed to other web apps, and Spring offers JMX wrapping at the price of a tiny amount of XML. However, we were unable to bind the JMX entities to the JNDI tree, so we couldn't lookup the objects from the web apps.</p>

<p>Then we tried binding the business layer directly to JNDI. Although Spring didn't offer any method for this, using JNDITemplate to bind them was also trivial. But this led to several new problems: 1) Security manager denies access to RMI classloader, so the client failed once we tried to invoke methods on the JNDI resource. 2) Once the security issues were resolved, JBoss threw IllegalArgumentException: object is not an instance of declaring class. A bit of reading reveals that we need stub implementations for the JNDI resources, but this seems like a lot of hassle (perhaps Spring can help us?)</p>

<p>We haven't looked too much into EJB yet, but after the first two tries I'm wondering if what we're trying to achieve is at all possible. </p>

<p>To sum up what we're trying to achieve: One JBoss instance, several web apps utilizing one stack of business objects on top of DAO layer and Hibernate.</p>

<pre><code>string FileToConvert = Server.MapPath(""."") + ""\\App_Data\\CP-ARFJN-FLAG.XLS"";
string connectionString = ""Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source="" + FileToConvert + "";Extended Properties=Excel 8.0;"";

//this next line assumes that the file is in default Excel format with Sheet1 as the first sheet name, adjust accordingly
OleDbDataAdapter adapter = new OleDbDataAdapter(""SELECT * FROM [CP-ARFJN-FLAG$]"", connection);
</code></pre>

<p>and this works just fine.  But when I try it on the actual file (it is supplied to me by another program) I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>System.Data.OleDb.OleDbException: External table is not in the expected format. at System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnectionInternal..ctor(OleDbConnectionString constr, OleDbConnection connection) at System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnectionFactory.CreateConnection(DbConnectionOptions options, Object poolGroupProviderInfo, DbConnectionPool pool, DbConnection owningObject) at System.Data.ProviderBase.DbConnectionFactory.CreateNonPooledConnection(DbConnection owningConnection, DbConnectionPoolGroup poolGroup) at System.Data.ProviderBase.DbConnectionFactory.GetConnection(DbConnection owningConnection) at System.Data.ProviderBase.DbConnectionClosed.OpenConnection(DbConnection outerConnection, DbConnectionFactory connectionFactory) at System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection.Open() at wetglobe.Page_Load(Object sender, EventArgs e)

<p>BUT, this is where I think the problem lies.  If I take that file, and save it with my local Excel, first I get this popup:</p>

<blockquote>

  that are not compatible with Text (Tab

  <li>To preserve the features, click No.

  <li>To see what might be lost, click

</blockquote>

<p>If I click No and then save it as the current Excel format, the program will then work fine.</p>

<p>So I am assuming this is saved in some crazy old Excel format?</p>

<p>I suppose my questions would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can I tell what Excel version

<li>How can I parse it in its current

<li>-or- Can I programatically save it as a newer version?</li>

<p>If you don't know, unison is a file synchronization tool, it runs an ""ssh"" command to connect to a remote server, but there's no ssh.exe for windows; there's plink, which is very close but not close enough (it doesn't behave like unison expects it to), so people usually make wrappers around it, <a href=""http://www.wischik.com/lu/programmer/unison-ssh.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">like this one</a>.</p>

<p>one of the problems is that unison expects the password prompt to print to stderr (but plink prints it to stdout, and causes unison to be confused), so I thought, well, should be simple enough, hack my thru plink's code and make it print the prompt to stdout. so I hacked my way through and did that.</p>

<p>Next problem: I can't respond to the prompt!! no matter what I type, it has no effect.</p>

<p>the code for getting input is roughly like this:</p>

<pre><code>hin = GetStdHandle(STD_INPUT_HANDLE);
....
r = ReadFile(hin, .....);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure why it's done this way, but I'm not an expert in designing command line tools for windows, so what do I know! But I figure something is missing in setting up the input handle.</p>

<p>I looked at the source code for the <a href=""http://www.wischik.com/lu/programmer/unison-ssh.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">above wrapper tool</a> and I see this: 
<code>hconin=CreateFile(""CONIN$"",GENERIC_READ|GENERIC_WRITE,FILE_SHARE_READ,0,OPEN_EXISTING,0,0)</code></p>

<p>Why is this? what is ""CONIN$""? and why is it different from the <code>STD_INPUT_HANDLE</code>?</p>

<p>I can sort of ""guess"" that <code>FILE_SHARE_READ</code> and <code>OPEN_EXISTING</code> are playing a role in this (since ssh is being run from within another process), but I want to understand what's going on here, and make sure that this code doesn't have some unwanted side effects or security holes or something scary like that!</p>

We are having a problem that may be specific to WebMethods, but if anyone can point me in a direction of what kinds of things might cause this I'd appreciate it.</p>

<p>When polling two of our partners' FTP servers, we connect without issue but, when doing a NLST on a directory that is empty (no files and no subdirectories) it's timing out.  The actual error is:</p>

<p>It's being thrown during the invocation of the pub.client.ftp:ls service.  I've logged in with a number of FTP clients without a problem to the same sites.  I've used whatever the default FTP client is in windows, FileZilla and lftp.  All without issue.  The servers themselves aren't the same FTP server software from what I can tell.  One is Microsoft FTP, the other I'm uncertain on but is definitely not Microsoft.</p>

<pre><code>void sieve(vector&lt;int&gt; v, BST&lt;int&gt; t, int n)
{
  vector&lt;int&gt; v_nonPrime(n);
  int i,j;
  for(i = 2; i &lt; n; i++)
      v_nonPrime[i] = i;

  for(i = 2; i &lt; n; i++)
     {

        for(j = i + 1; j &lt; n; j++)
           {
              if(v_nonPrime[i] % j == 0)
                 cout &lt;&lt; v_nonPrime[i] &lt;&lt; endl;
           }
     }
}

<ul>
<li>Drag events are events that take place when the user is dragging an object.  This is ""proper"" OS dragging, eg:  hiliting some text and dragging it, or even dragging in something from outside of the browser.</li>
<li>While dragging, as far as I can tell, no other browser events will be fired.  (onmouseover is ignored, for example).  The only events that work are drag events.</li>
<li>In all modern browsers, onDragEnter and onDragOver appear to work...  but firefox lacks ""onDragLeave.""</li>
<li>For dropping, FF uses ""onDragDrop"" while IE and others use ""onDrop"" while Safari doesn't appear to support it.</li>
<li>Events only seem to work on ""droppable"" elements, like textarea and text.  On other elements only <em>some</em> events work.</li>
<li>Various other quirks for each browser that I don't even want to go over.</li>
<li>There is very little documented about these events.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, I <strong>must</strong> use actual drag+drop, and cannot simulate it.</p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is there a way to detect ""ondragleave"" or similar in FF?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is there a way to detect ""ondragdrop"" or similar in Safari?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do you have anything to add about Drag + Drop?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a quick and dirty template demonstrating drag and drop events:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
    addEvent = function(obj, eventname, fn){
        if (document.addEventListener) obj.addEventListener(eventname, fn, false);
        else obj.attachEvent('on'+eventname, fn);
    }

    window.onload = function(){
        var logger = document.getElementById(""logger"");
        var log = function(str){ logger.value = str + logger.value; }

        //log a variety of drag events for the textarea
        var obj = document.getElementById(""tarea"");
        var events = [""dragenter"",""dragover"",""dragout"",""dragleave"",""dragdrop"",""drop""];
        for (var i=0; i&lt;events.length; i++){
            (function(event){//create a closure to remove variable scope
                addEvent(obj, event, function(){ log(""textarea: "" + event + ""\n""); });
            })(events[i]);
        }

        //log events on the div
        obj = document.getElementById(""div"");
        events = [""mouseover"",""mouseout"",""mouseup"",""mousedown"",""click"",""dblclick"",
                ""dragenter"",""dragover"",""dragout"",""dragleave"",""dragdrop"",""drop""];
        for (var i=0; i&lt;events.length; i++){
            (function(event){//create a closure to remove variable scope
                addEvent(obj, event, function(){ log(""div: "" + event + ""\n""); });
            })(events[i]);
        }
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
Life's a drag when doing cross browser stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div id=""div"" style=""width: 100px; height: 100px; background: green; float: left;""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;textarea id=""tarea"" style=""width: 100px; height: 100px; float: left; margin: 0px 5px;""&gt;
&lt;/textarea&gt;

&lt;textarea id=""logger"" style=""width: 200px; height: 400px; float: left;""&gt;
&lt;/textarea&gt;

<p>My question relates to the best way to actually send the e-mails. We have an SMTP server in our data centre which we can use.

<p>The Siebel web service requires that a header containing the username, password and session type be included with the service request, but the header is not defined in the WSDL.</p>

<p>So, when I test the WSDL using the soapUI utility, the request as defined by the WSDL looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" xmlns:lov=""http://www.siebel.com/xml/LOVService"" xmlns:lis=""http://www.siebel.com/xml/ListQuery""&gt;
&lt;soapenv:Header/&gt;
   &lt;soapenv:Body&gt;
      &lt;lov:EAILOVGetListOfValues_Input&gt;
         &lt;lis:ListsQuery&gt;
            &lt;lis:ListQuery&gt;
               &lt;lis:Active&gt;Y&lt;/lis:Active&gt;
               &lt;lis:LanguageCode&gt;ENU&lt;/lis:LanguageCode&gt;
               &lt;lis:Type&gt;CUT_ACCOUNT_TYPE&lt;/lis:Type&gt;

         &lt;/lis:ListsQuery&gt;
      &lt;/lov:EAILOVGetListOfValues_Input&gt;
   &lt;/soapenv:Body&gt;
&lt;/soapenv:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But the above does not work because it contains an empty header that is missing user and session credentials. It only works if I manually replace <code>&lt;soapenv:Header/&gt;</code> with a header containing the username, password, and session type as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" xmlns:lov=""http://www.siebel.com/xml/LOVService"" xmlns:lis=""http://www.siebel.com/xml/ListQuery""&gt;

  &lt;PasswordText xmlns=""http://siebel.com/webservices""&gt;TESTPASSWORD&lt;/PasswordText&gt;
  &lt;SessionType xmlns=""http://siebel.com/webservices""&gt;None&lt;/SessionType&gt;
&lt;/soapenv:Header&gt;
   &lt;soapenv:Body&gt;
      &lt;lov:EAILOVGetListOfValues_Input&gt;

         &lt;/lis:ListsQuery&gt;
      &lt;/lov:EAILOVGetListOfValues_Input&gt;
   &lt;/soapenv:Body&gt;
&lt;/soapenv:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is that I cannot sort out how to translate the above into VB.NET 2008 code.</p>

<p>I have no problem importing the WSDL into Visual Studio 2008, defining the service in VB code and referencing the web service methods. However, I cannot sort out how to define the web service in VB such that the updated header in included in the web service request instead of the empty header. Consequently all my service requests from VB fail.</p>

<p>I can define a class that inherits from the SoapHeader class...</p>

<pre><code>Public Class MySoapHeader : Inherits System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHeader
    Public Username As String
    Public Password As String
    Public SessionType As String
End Class
</code></pre>

<p>...but how do I include this header in the SOAP request made from VB?</p>

<p>The sample code I am using to test this is a simple form with a button and a list box.</p>

<pre><code>Public Class Form1

    Private Sub btnGetLOV_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnGetLOV.Click

        Dim MyService As New wsLOV.EAILOVPortClient

        Dim MyInput As New wsLOV.EAILOVGetListOfValues_Input
        Dim MyParams(0) As wsLOV.ListQuery
        Dim temp As New wsLOV.ListQuery

        Dim MyResult As New wsLOV.EAILOVGetListOfValues_Output

        temp.Active = ""Y""
        temp.Type = ""CUT_ACCOUNT_TYPE""
        temp.LanguageCode = ""ENU""
        MyParams(0) = temp

        MyInput.ListsQuery = MyParams

        Dim MyRequest As New wsLOV.EAILOVGetListOfValuesRequest(MyInput)
        MyResult = MyService.EAILOVGetListOfValues(MyInput)


    End Sub

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>The code fails on the last line of the subroutine with a message indicating that the request has not been authenticated (Error Code: 10944642 Error Message: Error: Inbound SOAP Message - Session Token is missing or invalid or has expired) which is the same error I get in soapUI when I leave off the header containing username, password, and session type.</p>

<p>I believe I need to add the header to the endpoint (per <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms731749.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms731749.aspx</a> and <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.configuration.serviceendpointelement.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.configuration.serviceendpointelement.aspx</a>) but I am not sure how to do this in VB.</p>

<p>I need to create 32 Bit numbers (signed or unsigned doesn't matter, the highest bit will never be set anyway) and each number must have a given number of Bits set.</p>

<h2>Naive Solution</h2>

<p>The easiest solution is of course to start with the number of zero. Within a loop the number is now increased by one, the number of Bits is counted, if the count has the desired value, the number is stored to a list, if not the loop just repeats. The loop is stopped if enough numbers have been found. Of course this works just fine, but it's awfully slow once the number of desired Bits gets very high.</p>

<h2>A Better Solution</h2>

<p>The simplest number having (let's say) 5 Bits set is the number where the first 5 Bit are set. This number can be easily created. Within a loop the first bit is set and the number is shifted to the left by one. This loop runs 5 times and I found the first number with 5 Bits set. The next couple of numbers are easy to create as well. We now pretend the number to be 6 Bit wide and the highest one is not set. Now we start shifting the first zero bit to the right, so we get 101111, 110111, 111011, 111101, 111110. We could repeat this by adding another 0 to front and repeating this process. 0111110, 1011110, 1101110, etc. However that way numbers will grow much faster than necessary, as using this simple approach we leave out numbers like 1010111.</p>

<p>So is there a better way to create all possible permutations, a generic approach, that can be used, regardless how many bits the next number will have and regardless how many set bits we need set?</p>

<p>This is in a simple form with only a textbox control (with multiline set to true) in it. The exception gets thrown on the <code>DownloadString(...)</code> line.  I also tried using <code>WebRequest</code>.. same exception!</p>

<p>I am using Windows XP and not running any kind of firewall. Only AVG at the moment. I'm pretty sure I shouldn't have to forward any ports or anything, but I did try forwarding port 80 to my workstation on my router. Didn't help.</p>

The first area that I am concentrating is the attendance area for the teachers to report attendance (and some other data) about the kids. This needs to be fast.</p>

<p>I've created a dual-control set up where the user clicks on the icon and via Javascript and Jquery I pop up the second control. Then I use a __doPostBack() to refresh the pop up control to load all of the relevant data.</p>

<p>Here's a little video snippet to show how it works: <a href=""http://www.screencast.com/users/cyberjared/folders/Jing/media/32ef7c22-fe82-4b60-a74a-9a37ab625f1f"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.screencast.com/users/cyberjared/folders/Jing/media/32ef7c22-fe82-4b60-a74a-9a37ab625f1f</a> (:21 and ignore the audio background).</p>

<p>It's slower than I would like at 2-3 seconds in Firefox and Chrome for each ""popping up"", but it's entirely unworkable in IE, taking easily 7-8 seconds for each time it pops up and loads. And that disregards any time that is needed to save the data after it's been changed.</p>

<p>Here's the javascript that handles the pop-up:</p>

<pre><code>function showAttendMenu(callingControl, guid) {
var myPnl = $get('"" + this.MyPnl.ClientID + @""')
if(myPnl) {
    var displayIDFld = $get('"" + this.AttendanceFld.ClientID + @""');
    var myStyle = myPnl.style;
    if(myStyle.display == 'block' &amp;&amp; (guid== '' || guid == displayIDFld.value)) {
        myStyle.display = 'none';
    } else {
        // Get a reference to the PageRequestManager.
        var prm = Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance();

        // Unblock the form when a partial postback ends.
        prm.add_endRequest(function() {
            $('#"" + this.MyPnl.ClientID + @""').unblock({ fadeOut: 0});
        });

        var domEl = Sys.UI.DomElement;
        //Move it into position
        var loc = domEl.getLocation(callingControl);
        var width = domEl.getBounds(callingControl).width;
        domEl.setLocation(myPnl, loc.x + width, loc.y - 200);

        //Show it and block it until we finish loading the data
        myStyle.display = 'block';
        $('#"" + this.MyPnl.ClientID + @""').block({ message: null, overlayCSS: { backgroundColor:'#fff', opacity: '0.7'} }); 

        //Load the data
        if(guid != '') { displayIDFld.value = guid; } 
        __doPostBack('"" + UpdatePanel1.ClientID + @""','');
    }
}}
</code></pre>

<p>First, I don't understand why the __doPostBack() introduces such a delay in IE. If I take that and the prm.add_endRequest out, it's VERY speedy as no postback is happening.</p>

<p>Second, I need a way to pop up this control and refresh the data so that it is still interactive. I'm not married to an UpdatePanel, but I haven't been able to figure out how to do it with a Web Service/static page method. As you can see this control is loaded many times on the same page so page size and download speed is an issue.</p>

<p>I'd appreciate any ideas?</p>

<p>Edit: It's the same in IE 6 or 7. I'm thinking it has to do with IE's handling of the UpdatePanel, because the same code is much faster in FF and Chrome.</p>

<p>I realize there are no real callbacks in Java.</p>

<p>Here's my approach, is there a library which already does this stuff? Feel free to suggest improvements, too.</p>

<p>Register call to Scheduler passes:</p>

<ul>
<li>a time specification containing hour, minute, second, year month, dom, dow, where each item may be unspecified, meaning ""execute it every hour / minute etc."" (just like crontabs)</li>
<li>an object containing data that will tell the calling object what to do when it is notified by the Scheduler. The Scheduler does not process this data, just stores it and passes it back upon notification.</li>
<li>a reference to the calling object</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon startup, or after a new registration request, the Scheduler starts with a Calendar object of the current system time and checks if there are any entries in the database that match this point in time. If there are, they are executed and the process starts over. If there aren't, the time in the Calendar object is incremented by one second and the entreis are rechecked. This repeats until there is one entry or more that match(es). (Discrete Event Simulation)</p>

<p>The Scheduler will then remember that timestamp, sleep and wake every second to check if it is already there. If it happens to wake up and the time has already passed, it starts over, likewise if the time has come and the jobs have been executed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default, ASP.NET does not use impersonation, and your code runs using the ASP.NET application's process identity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I have the following web.config</p>

<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;

    &lt;appSettings/&gt;
    &lt;connectionStrings/&gt;

    &lt;system.web&gt;
        &lt;!-- 
            Set compilation debug=""true"" to insert debugging

            The &lt;customErrors&gt; section enables configuration 
            of what to do if/when an unhandled error occurs 
            during the execution of a request. Specifically, 
            it enables developers to configure html error pages 
            to be displayed in place of a error stack trace.

        &lt;customErrors mode=""RemoteOnly"" defaultRedirect=""GenericErrorPage.htm""&gt;
            &lt;error statusCode=""403"" redirect=""NoAccess.htm"" /&gt;

        &lt;/customErrors&gt;
        --&gt;
    &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So it seem impersonation is disabled just like <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms998351.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the article</a> is suggesting.</p>

<p>My aspx is blank default and the codebehind is</p>

<pre><code>namespace TestWebapp
{
    public partial class _Default : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(String.Format(""Before1: Current Princupal = {0}"", Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity.Name));
            WindowsImpersonationContext ctx = WindowsIdentity.Impersonate(IntPtr.Zero);
            try
            {
                int a = 0;
                System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(String.Format(""After: Current Princupal = {0}"", Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity.Name));
            } finally
            {
                ctx.Undo();
            }

        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I reload the page I get the following debug output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[5288] Before1: Current Princupal =
  DOMAIN\User
  [5288] After: Current Princupal =
  DOMAIN\User</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Output is the same with</p>

<pre><code>&lt;identity impersonate=""false""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The web site uses Default Application Pool and the pool is set up to use NETWORK SERVICE account for its worker processes.
I'm sure the application uses the web.config it should use and the w3p.exe worker process is running under NETWORK SERVICE.</p>

<p>What can be wrong in this case?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>@Edit: Rob, thanks for the tip! 
The $user shortcut shows me that everything is happening as I expect: with impersonation on I have the process running user NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE    and the thread has DOMAIN\User before WindowsIdentity.Impersonate(IntPtr.Zero) and ""No Token. Thread not impersonating."" after.
But Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity.Name and HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.Name still give me DOMAIN\User in both places.</p>

<p>@Edit: I've found out that to get Thread.CurrentPrincipal and HttpContext.Current.User changed I have to manually do it:</p>

<pre><code>Thread.CurrentPrincipal = new WindowsPrincipal(WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent());
HttpContext.Current.User = Thread.CurrentPrincipal;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure what's the point here, but anyway. I now have a problem with sharepoint shared services manage user profile permission but that's another question.</p>

<p>To me a compiler is made up of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lexer</li>
<li>Parser (which builds the syntax tree)</li>
<li>Generate Intermediate code (like 3 address code)</li>
<li>Do all these crazy things to optimize if you want :-)</li>
<li>Generate ""assembly"" or ""native code"" from the 3 address code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, obviously, the interpreter also has the same lexer and parser as the compiler.<br>
But what does it do after that?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Does it ""read"" the syntax tree and execute it directly? (kind of like having an instruction pointer pointing to the current node in the tree, and the execution is one big tree traversal plus the memory management for the call stack) (and if so, how does it do it? I'm hoping the execution is better than a huge switch statement that checks what type of node it is)</p></li>
<li><p>Does it generate 3 address code and interpret that? (if so, how does it do it? Again, I'm looking for something more elegant than a mile long switch statement)</p></li>
<li>Does it generate real native code, load it into memory, and make it run? (at which point I'm guessing it's not an interpreter anymore, but more like a JIT compiler)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, at which point does the concept of ""virtual machine"" cut in? What do you use a virtual machine for in a language? (to be clear about my level of ignorance, to me a virtual machine is VMWare, I have no idea how the concept of VM applies to programming languages / executing programs).  </p>

<p>As you can see, my question is quite broad. I'm mostly looking for not only which method is used but mostly to first understand the big concepts, and then get into how it works in detail. I want the ugly, raw details. Obviously, this is more a quest for references to things to read rather than expecting you to answer all these details in here.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>
Daniel</p>

<p>EDIT: Thank you for your answers so far. I realized my title was misleading though. I understand the ""functional"" difference between a compiler and an interpreter.<br>
What i'm looking for is the difference as to how you <em>implement</em> an interpreter, vs a compiler.<br>
I understand now how a compiler is implemented, the question is how an interpreter differs from that.</p>

<p>For example: VB6 is clearly both a compiler and an interpreter. I understand now the compiler part. However, I can not grasp how, when running inside the IDE, it could let me stop the program at any arbitrary point, change the code, and resume execution with the new code.
That's just one tiny example, it's not the answer i'm looking for. What i'm trying to understand, as I explain below, is what happens after I have a parse tree. A compiler will generate new code from it in the ""target"" language. What does an interpreter do?</p>

<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<p>Is any of the interrupt responsibility determined by the physical board's configuration?  Each processor must be able to handle some types of interrupts, like disk I/O.  Unless there is some circuitry to manage and dispatch interrupts to the appropriate processor?  My guess is that the scheme must be processor neutral, so that any processor and core can run the interrupt handler.</p>

<p>If a core is waiting on a disk read, will that core be the one to run the interrupt handler when the disk is ready? </p>

<p>A secondary concern has been using a modern ORM in the middle tier.  Our first choice has always been Entity Framework, mainly because the developers like to work with it.  (They love the LiNQ support.)</p>

<p>So here's the problem:</p>

<p>With peer-to-peer replication in mind, I settled on using uniqueidentifier with a default value of newsequentialid() for the primary key of every table.  This seemed to provide a good balance between avoiding key collisions and reducing index fragmentation.</p>

<p>However, it turns out that the current version of Entity Framework has a <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/dsimmons/pages/ef-faq-entity-services.aspx#Section_17"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">very strange limitation</a>: if an entity's key column is a uniqueidentifier (GUID) then it cannot be configured to use the default value (newsequentialid()) provided by the database.  The application layer must generate the GUID and populate the key value.</p>

<p>So here's the debate:</p>

<ol>
<li>abandon Entity Framework and use another ORM:

<ul>
<li>use NHibernate and give up LiNQ support</li>
<li>use linq2sql and give up future support (not to mention get bound to SQL Server on DB)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>abandon GUIDs and go with another PK strategy</li>
<li>devise a method to generate sequential GUIDs (COMBs?) at the application layer</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm leaning towards option 1 with linq2sql (my developers really like linq2[stuff]) and 3.  That's mainly because I'm somewhat ignorant of alternate key strategies that support the replication scheme we're aiming for while also keeping things sane from a developer's perspective.</p>

<p>Any insight or opinion would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>My question is, why does this work, and what is happening?  I have a guess, and I tried to prove it by looking at IL, but I'm only kidding myself if I think I can break down IL.  But my guess is, auto properties work by having the compiler generate fields for your properties behind the scenes.  Those fields cannot be accessed through code, all setting and getting must be done through the properties.  When creating a struct, a default constructor cannot be explicitly defined.  So behind the scenes, the compiler must be generating a default constructor that sets the values of the fields that the developer can't see.</p>

<p>Any and all IL wizards are welcome to prove or disprove my theory.</p>

<p>I need the same on my new mac. I know mac os x comes with a local webserver. Is this already with php, mysql preinstalled? </p>

<p>I'd like to have you guys advise on the easiest way to have this local lamp so that i can continue developing on this nice and shiny machine.</p>

<p>thanks!</p>

<hr>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>The Idea is to notify the user using the memo when a packet is received/sent in a TCP Client.</p>

<p>After couple of fixes,the most suitable solution seemed to be this one</p>

<pre><code>    public string TextValue
    {
        set
        {
            this.Memo.Text += value + ""\n"";
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>That's how it's being called</p>

<pre><code>    var form = Form.ActiveForm as Form1;
    if(form != null)
        form.TextValue = ""Test asdasd"";
</code></pre>

<p>However,calling the code throws an exception ,because of Unsafe thread call.I found a solution at <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171728.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">msdn</a>,but I can't seem to acquire the method they've used there.</p>

<p>This is my remake,which doesn't work.</p>

<pre><code>    private void SetTextMemo(string txt)
    {
        if(this.Memo.InvokeRequired)
        {
            this.Invoke(SetTextMemo,txt); //error here
        }
        else
        {
            this.Memo.Text += txt + ""\n"";
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>errors:</p>

<p>Argument '1': cannot convert from 'method group' to 'System.Delegate'</p>

<p>Argument '2': cannot convert from 'string' to 'object[]'</p>

<p>Basically,I'm trying to access the Memo(or more likely said,add text to the memo) from another thread using Invoke.I never used it before,maybe that's why I misunderstand my mistake.</p>

<p>It works ok with around 100 buttons, but bump that up to 1000 and it's in trouble. Bump that up to 5000 and it just dies after 20 seconds.</p>

<p>I have very little custom code, and I make judicious use of suspend and resume layout.</p>

<p>So what am I doing wrong? I'm sure my (fairly rapid) computer should be able to handle a few thousand buttons and labels.</p>

<p>(I'm fairly new to C# GUI stuff, so perhaps I should be doing things completely different anyway.)</p>

<p>Edit 1:</p>

<p>This is pretty much the only custom code at the moment:</p>

<pre><code>flowLayoutPanel1.SuspendLayout();
foreach (DataRow row in dt.Rows) // dt is from a DB query
{
    flowLayoutPanel1.Controls.Add(new PersonButton(row));
}
flowLayoutPanel1.ResumeLayout();
</code></pre>

<p>and in the PersonButton constructor:</p>

<pre><code>this.label1.Text = row[""FirstName""].ToString().Trim() + "" ""
    + row[""Surname""].ToString().Trim();
</code></pre>

<p>(There should also be a picture attached but I'm not sure if anyone can see it.)</p>

<p>Edit 2:</p>

<p>I guess I really should be using a DataGridView, or ListView, but I wanted more than just a line of text and a small icon per row; I wanted it to look similar to the downloads view in firefox (Ctrl + J). (See screenshot)</p>

<p>Thanks very much for all your input, BTW. I guess I'll have to rethink...</p>

<p>Say for e.g. you have about 10000 records and this data gets populated when the page loads and this happens in chunks of say 100 records per webservice request.</p>

<p>To enable editing on these rows what approach would you follow.</p>

<p>Just to give an example say the object model for the fictitious scenario is given below.</p>

<p>List customers;   // list of customers</p>

<p>customers = ServiceFacade.GetAllCustomers(pageSize, currentPage);</p>

<p>Assume the above service calls brings back 50 records based on the pageSize displaying 10 records per page.</p>

<p>This will be bound to the gridView as below.</p>

<ul>
<li>Disable viewstate for gridview (as this will slow down the performance of the page).</li>
<li>Use session object to persist the change (OR what would you recommend.  Is two way binding really helpful here, I don't know as I haven't tried it.)</li>

<p>Your ideas/suggestions are greatly appreciated.  I understand I could be flamed for this, but I think the good old DataSet may be useful here (as it has all the essential information which enables tracking changes etc).</p>

<pre><code>Exceptions.DontSwallowErrorsCatchingNonspecificExceptionsRule  : 2106 defects

<p>The developers assure me they had good reason for all the empty catch blocks, that sometimes the try with empty catch blocks are just there to ignore useless exceptions and keep the application from crashing.  I feel this is a cop out and complete BS.  Some of the examples I actually looked up were database calls where the record was being saved to the database, and in this case, if an exception was ignored, the user would get back an okay prompt, think everything was okay, and continue on with their work.  In reality, their work was never saved.  I think this is absolutely the most horrible kind of error.  In this case, they are completely wrong in throwing that code in a try with an empty catch block.  But my question is, ""Is this EVER acceptable in ANY situation?""

<p>I figured that the <code>array_unique</code> is somewhat O(n^2 - n) and here's my implementation:</p>

<pre><code>function array_unique2($array) 
{ 
    $to_return = array(); 
    $current_index = 0;

    for ( $i = 0 ; $i &lt; count($array); $i++ ) 
    { 
        $current_is_unique = true; 

        for ( $a = $i+1; $a &lt; count($array); $a++ ) 
        { 
            if ( $array[$i] == $array[$a] ) 
            { 
                $current_is_unique = false; 
                break; 
            } 
        } 
        if ( $current_is_unique ) 
        { 
            $to_return[$current_index] = $array[$i];
        } 

    } 

    return $to_return; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>However when benchmarking this against the <code>array_unique</code> i got the following result:</p>

<p>Testing (array_unique2)... Operation took 0.52146291732788 s. </p>

<p>Testing (array_unique)... Operation took 0.28323101997375 s.</p>

<p>Which makes the array_unique twice as fast, my question is, why ( Both had the same random data ) ?</p>

<p>And a friend of mine wrote the following:</p>

<pre><code>function array_unique2($a)
{
    $n = array();
    foreach ($a as $k=&gt;$v)
        if (!in_array($v,$n))
            $n[$k]=$v;
    return $n;
}
</code></pre>

<p>which is twice as fast as the built in one in php.</p>

<p>I'd like to know, why?</p>

<p>What is the time-complexity of array_unique and in_array?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
I removed the count($array) from both loops and just used a variable in the top of the function, that gained 2 seconds on 100 000 elements!</p>

<p>The problem is python seems to break it into several stages. tp_new, tp_init and tp_alloc for creation and tp_del, tp_free and tp_dealloc for destruction. However c++ just has new which allocates and fully constructs the object and delete which destructs and deallocates the object.</p>

<p>Which of the python tp_* methods do I need to provide and what must they do?</p>

<p>Also I want to be able to create the object directly in c++ eg ""PyObject *obj = new MyExtensionObject(args);"" Will I also need to overload the new operator in some way to support this?</p>

<p>I also would like to be able to subclass my extension types in python, is there anything special I need to do to support this?</p>

<p>I'm using python 3.0.1.</p>

<p>EDIT:
ok, tp_init seems to make objects a bit too mutable for what I'm doing (eg take a Texture object, changing the contents after creation is fine, but change fundamental aspects of it such as, size, bitdept, etc will break lots of existing c++ stuff that assumes those sort of things are fixed). If I dont implement it will it simply stop people calling __init__ AFTER its constructed (or at least ignore the call, like tuple does). Or should I have some flag that throws an exception or somthing if tp_init is called more than once on the same object?</p>

<p>My current project is a large-ish public site (2 million pageviews per day) site running a mixture of asp classic and asp.net with a SQL Server 2005 back-end. We're heavy on reads, with occasional writes and virtually no updates/deletes. Our pages typically concern a single 'master' object with a stack of dependent (detail) objects. </p>

<p>I like the idea of returning all the data required for a page in a single proc (and absolutely no unnecesary data). True, this requires a dedicated proc for such pages, but some pages receive double-digit percentages of our overall site traffic so it's worth the time/maintenance hit. We typically only consume multiple-recordsets from our .net code, using System.Data.SqlClient.SqlDataReader and it's NextResult method. Oh, yeah, I'm not doing any updates/inserts in these procs either (except to table variables).</p>

<h2>The question</h2>

<p>SQL Server (2005) procs which return multiple recordsets are working well (in prod) for us so far but I am a little worried that multi-recordset procs are my new favourite hammer that i'm hitting every problem (nail) with. Are there any multi-recordset sql server proc gotchas I should know about? Anything that's going to make me wish I hadn't used them? Specifically anything about it affecting connection pooling, memory utilization etc.</p>

Command format of GPRS packets are as follows:

From server to tracker:

From tracker to server: 
$$\r\n

Note: 
Do NOT input ‘’ when writing a command. 
All multi-byte data complies with the following sequence: High byte prior to low byte. 
The size of a GPRS packet (including data) is about 100 bytes

@@          2 bytes. It means the header of packet from server to tracker. 
            It is in ASCII code (Hex code: 0x40)

$$          2 bytes. It is the header of packet from tracker to server.
            It is in ASCII code (Hex code: 0x24)

L           2 bytes. It means the length of the whole packet including 
            the header and ending character and it is in hex code

ID          7 bytes, ID must be digit and not over 14 digits, the unused byte 
            will be stuffed by ‘f’ or ‘0xff’. It is in the format of hex code.
            For example, if ID is 13612345678, then it will be shown as 
            follows: 0x13, 0x61, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x8f, 0xff.
            If all 7 bytes are 0xff, it is a broadcasting command. ID is in hex code

command     2 bytes. The command code is in hex code. Please refer to the 
            command list below.

<p>I'm also not opposed to exporting the data in, for instance, csv format and loading it into another program if that would be easier.</p>

<p>Tried CairoPlot:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; data = [(10, 0), (11, 1), (12.5, 0), (15, 1)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; def fn(t):

&gt;&gt;&gt; CairoPlot.function_plot( 'tester.png', data, 500, 300, discrete = True, h_bounds=( data[0][0],data[-1][0]), step = 1 )

<p>This pinned my CPU at 100% for more than 10 minutes and was steadily eating memory. I killed it before it used up all of swap. Am I doing something wrong or is CairoPlot just broken?</p>

<p>Further edit:</p>

<p>I now have something more workable using CairoPlot, based loosely on the above code. However, it's not perfect because of the resolution: I may need up to tens of nanoseconds (1e-8) resolution in order to catch some of the shorter pulses. For a multi-second graph, this takes a <em>very</em> long time with this method.</p>

<p>I know that theoretically the answer is yes. I also created demo applications and changed the lookandfeel even at runtime and it worked. But when I created a real application with lots of controls lookandfeel change was not really working:</p>

<ul>
<li>Different lookandfeels have different bugs (or strange features). For instance some of them creates the same style for JTextField and JFormattedTextField, some of them uses different styles. This change can be quite annoying for users.</li>
<li>Control sizes are not the same (using different fonts, different borders), so sometimes the window looks ugly after change.</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts can also be different.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>In my applications after lookandfeel change (actually instead of changing the lookandfeel I tried using the same lookandfeel with different skins) I always have to modify the application. Not a very big modification, but lots of small modifications which makes lookandfeel change difficult.</p>

<p>Am I just very unlucky with the lookandfeels I tried (currently using <a href=""http://www.l2fprod.com/skinlf/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">skinlf</a>), or lookandfeel change is not that easy as in small demo applications?</p>

<p>UPDATE: I'm using Swing and changing to other GUI library is not possible for me right now.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE2</strong>: It seems to me the question was not clear. I do know how to change the lookandfeel. My questions is: Is it possible to create a real application where changing lookandfeel (or the skin of the lookandfeel) is an easy task? Currently if I change the lookandfeel it is not enough to change 2 or 3 lines, I have to review the whole application and fix quite  a few problems caused by the lookandfeel change. dhiller suggested replacing skinlf with a better lookandfeel. Can you show me a skinable lookandfeel where skin replacement works better?</p>

Canonical example is file renames - you must commit any file renames first and do any further modifications later; however, file rename may require code refactoring to reflect namespace or class name change so you basically need to commit a single logic operation in two steps.

I have code that lets me drag the form around (it has no border or title) which continues to work.  I also have my won close button which functions when I click it.

<p>""The easiest way to prove that some new problem is NP-complete is first to prove that it is in NP, and then to reduce some known NP-complete problem to it""</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that I understand this:  If I have a problem, I can show that it is NP-Complete if I: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>show that it is in NP (a solution to
the problem can be verified in
polynomial time on a
non-deterministic Turing machine)</p></li>
<li><p>Show that a problem already known to be NP-Complete can be
'reduced' to the new problem</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, my question is, how were the first NP-complete problems 'proven' to be NP-complete?  At one time, the set of known NP-complete problems must have been zero, and this would have made it impossible to resort to step 2 in the above process.  </p>

<p>This makes me think that there is a different method for proof which I'm not aware of.  Either that, or maybe the whole NP-complete property is 'assumed' for certain problems due to lack of a known polynomial time solution. (actually, having written this, I wouldn't be surprised if this is the case, but I'd like some guru-feedback either way). </p>

<a href=""http://#cgi.server_name##cgi.script_name#?#cgi.query_string#"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://#cgi.server_name##cgi.script_name#?#cgi.query_string#</a></p>

<p>however, ""cgi.script_name"" automatically includes the default cfm file for that folder-  eg, that code, when parsed and expanded, is going to show us ""<a href=""http://www.example.com/sub1/index.cfm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.example.com/sub1/index.cfm</a>""</p>

<p>So, whether the user is visiting sub1/index.cfm or sub1/, the ""cgi.script_name"" var is going to include that ""index.cfm"".</p>

<p>The question is, how does one figure out which URL the user actually visited?  This question is mostly for SEO-purposes-  It's often preferable to 301 redirect ""/index.cfm"" to ""/"" to make sure there's only one URL for any piece of content-  Since this is mostly for the benefit of spiders, javascript isn't an appropriate solution in this case.  Also, assume one does not have access to isapi_rewrite or mod_rewrite-  The question is how to achieve this within ColdFusion, specifically.</p>

I'm a java developer by day, but I have a project I need to do in C++, intended to run on windows machines. Hence, I'm stuck messing about with Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Bascally, I have an os project that I added an accessor method to. I compiled that project as a .lib file (compiles and links fine). </p>

<p>I then have my own project that uses that lib. I've included the library under Project->Properties -> Linker -> Input, and set the appropriate directory in the General -> Additional Lib Directories. I've included the header in the appropriate file, and I'm simply calling the constructor of one of the classes...not even calling the method that I created yet.</p>

<p>The code compiles, but I get the following mountain of linker errors -- mostly LNK2019 and LNK2001 errors. I've tried recompiling under different settings (lib, exe, etc.), and the linker errors only seem to multiply. When I switch back to the previous settings, the number of errors remain at their peak. Any ideas how to fix this?</p>

I stumbled upon location.hash (e.g. <code>http://anywhere/index.html#somehashvalue</code>) to circumvent the refresh problem (use location.hash to inform your app of it's current state and use a page load handler to reset that state). It's really nice and simple.</p>

<p>This brought me to thinking about using location.hash to track the history of my app. I don't want to use existing libraries, because they use iframes etc. So here's my nickel and dime: when the application page loads I start this:</p>

<pre><code>setInterval(
       function(){
           if (location.hash !== appCache.currentHash) {
               appCache.currentHash = location.hash;
               appCache.history.push(location.hash);
               /* ... [load state using the hash value] ... */
               return true;
           }
           return false;
       }, 250
 );
</code></pre>

<p>(<em>appCache</em> is a predefined object containing application variables) The idea is to trigger every action in the application from the hash value. In decent browsers a hash value change adds an entry to the history, in IE (&lt;= 7) it doesn't. In all browsers, navigating back or forward to a page with another hash value doesn't trigger a page refresh. That's where the intervalled function takes over. With the function everytime the hash value change is detected (programmatically, or by clicking back or forward) the app can take appropriate action. The application can keep track of it's own history and I should be able to present history buttons in the application (especially for IE users).</p>

<p>As far as I can tell this works cross browser and there's no cost in terms of memory or processor resources. So my question is: would this be a viable solution to manage the history in XHR-apps? What are the pros and cons?</p>

<p>Update: because I use my homebrew framework, I didn't want to use one of the existing frameworks. To be able to use location.hash in IE and having it in it's history too, I created a simple script (yes, it's needs an iframe) which may be of use to you. I published it <a href=""http://www.nicon.nl/hash2history/"" rel=""noreferrer"">on my site</a>, feel free to use/modify/critizise it.</p>

I've read ScottGu's post on <a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/08/28/423888.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/08/28/423888.aspx</a> and tried to follow his patterns but run-time the child controls of my controls are not being initialised.</p>

<p>My setup: 
I'm using Visual Studio 2008 
I've created a solution to hold the controls I want to distribute to several other solutions. This solution contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>library projects (for model code, etc.), let's call this <em>""ClassLibrary""</em></li>
<li>a WebApp project (with my User Controls), let's call this <em>""Innermost""</em></li>
<li>a number of other WebApp projects acting as Shells for the Innermost project, let's regard one of them and call it <em>""Outer""</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The thought behind this is that Innermost contains the functionality and Outer contains any special modifications needed to make Innermost -controls work in a particular framework.</p>

<p>The ClassLibrary has code like this (this is all from a demo-setup I made to make sure it was an ASP issue, not something else I was doing):</p>

<pre><code>using System;

namespace ClassLibrary {
    public class LibraryClass {
        public long getLong() {
            return DateTime.Now.Ticks;
        }

        public string getString() {
            return DateTime.Now.ToString();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Innermost references the library project and works fine. This is an example of a UserControl in this project:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Control Language=""C#"" AutoEventWireup=""true"" 
    CodeBehind=""WebUserControl1.ascx.cs"" 
    Inherits=""Innermost.UserControls.WebUserControl1"" %&gt;
&lt;asp:Label ID=""testLabel"" runat=""server""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>with code-behind: </p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Web.UI;
using ClassLibrary;

namespace Innermost.UserControls {
    public partial class WebUserControl1 : UserControl {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
            LibraryClass c = new LibraryClass();
            testLabel.Text = ""Your number is "" + c.getLong();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have a test page in the Innermost project which uses the User Controls of the Innermost project by registering them with the following syntax:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Page Language=""C#"" AutoEventWireup=""true"" CodeBehind=""Test1.aspx.cs"" 
    Inherits=""Innermost.Test1"" %&gt;

&lt;%@ Register TagPrefix=""inner"" TagName=""Control1"" 
    Src=""~/UserControls/WebUserControl1.ascx"" %&gt;
&lt;%@ Register TagPrefix=""inner"" TagName=""Control2""
    Src=""~/UserControls/WebUserControl2.ascx"" %&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"" 
    ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""&gt;
&lt;head runat=""server""&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form id=""form1"" runat=""server""&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Control 1:
    &lt;inner:Control1 ID=""control1"" runat=""server"" /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    Control 2:
    &lt;inner:Control2 ID=""control2"" runat=""server"" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The Outer project references Innermost and ClassLibrary; and contains UserControls with the following registering of the Innermost controls:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Control Language=""C#"" AutoEventWireup=""true"" 
    CodeBehind=""TopControl.ascx.cs"" Inherits=""Outer.Control.TopControl"" %&gt;
&lt;%@ Register TagPrefix=""inner"" Assembly=""Innermost""
    Namespace=""Innermost.UserControls"" %&gt;
&lt;inner:WebUserControl1 ID=""Control1"" runat=""server""/&gt;
&lt;inner:WebUserControl2 ID=""Control2"" runat=""server""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With a simple code-behind:
    using System;
    using System.Web.UI;</p>

<pre><code>namespace Outer.Control {
    public partial class TopControl : UserControl {
        public bool ShowType1 { get; set; }

        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
            Control1.Visible = ShowType1;
            Control2.Visible = !ShowType1;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I run the test-page in the Innermost project I get no errors, and everything works. When I run the Outer project I get <code>NullReferenceException</code>s telling me that the child controls of the <code>Innermost.UserControls.WebUserControlX</code> have not been set.</p>

<p>StackTrace:</p>

<pre><code>[NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.]

<p>I can provide the test setup as solutions if anyone wants to have a closer look at this.</p>

<p>So, finally, my question is: Why do the ChildControls of the controls not get set up as expected? Even if I run <code>CreateChildControls()</code> in the Init of the outer controls they aren't being created. Is there some particular way I need to compile the Innermost project for use in the Outer project?</p>

<p>All the data I need to hold about the maze can be stored in 16 bit integers using bitwise operations (to represent each cell of the maze):<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TEaN5.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TEaN5.gif"" alt=""alt text""></a><br>

<em>16 bit unsigned integer</em></p>

<p>So, I figured a 2d array of 16bit integers and I'm good to go for my Maze data structure.  I wanted to keep the size of the data structure down so I can easily create <a href=""http://taint.org/x/2007/cake-maze.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">very dense mazes</a>.</p>

<p>So, I need to be able to create a 2-d array of 16bit integers of n*m size, dynamically at run time.  Somewhere on SO I read that 2d arrays in C++ are simply syntatic sugar for 1d arrays of [n<code>*</code>m] size and you can access elements via [row + col * width].</p>

<p>Here is my working attempt at this:</p>

<pre><code>class Maze {
    public:

        Maze(int mazeWidth, int mazeHeight)
        {
            mazeGrid = new unsigned int16_t[width*height];
            width = mazeWidth;
            height = mazeHeight;
        }

        unsigned int16_t getArrayValue(int row, int col)
        {
            return mazeGrid[row + col*width];
        }

        void setArrayValue(int row, int col, unsigned int16_t value)
        {
            mazeGrid[row + col*width] = value;
        }

    private:
        int width, height;
        unsigned int16_t *mazeGrid;

}
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone with some C++ knowledge have some suggestions for my Maze class?  I'm very new to C++ so this is all a learning experience for me.</p>

<p>The problem statement is this </p>

<ol>
<li>Simulate a coin toss for 20 times and record the number of heads
&amp; longest run of heads. </li>
<li>Simulate a coin toss and record the number of flips necessary until 2,3,4 heads occur in sequence (consecutively) (negative binomial?)</li>
<li>Make 100 runs with different seeds to find the distribution of items recorded.</li>
</ol>

<p>How does one go about solving this in the programming language R ? </p>

<p>For 1, I did the following:</p>

<pre><code>n=20                #no of trials
y=NULL              #initializing a vector of NULL values   
for (i in 1:n) {
    x=runif(1)      #random uniform
    if (x&lt;0.5) {    #if condition for assigning heads / tails
        y[i]='H'
    } else {
       y[i]='T'
    }
}
y                   #print the vector storing the heads and tails.
</code></pre>

<p>For 2, I understand that this is a case of negative binomial because it says ""until 2,3,4 heads occur in sequence"" . But I am not sure how to proceed to write the code in R or come up with the logic.</p>

<p>For 3, I am guessing have to calculate the number of heads got in 100 runs, run lengths of heads. But what does it imply to set <em>different seeds</em>? I am unsure of that.</p>

<p><strong>note</strong> This is a homework problem, yes (I am not able to tag it so). I do not need the code, just some pointers/ corrections/clarifications/suggestions would help. </p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> For simulating 2, I tried out the following code on MATLAB - </p>

<pre><code>head_count = 0;
flip_count = 0;

while (head_count &lt; 3)                  #counting for 3 multiple heads
    flip = rand(1);
    flip_count = flip_count+1;
    if (flip &gt; 0.5)
        head_count = head_count + 1;
    else 
         head_count = 0;       #invalidate head counts if not successive.
    end
end
disp(flip_count)
</code></pre>

<p>Please let me know if this logic is correct. And I can recreate it using R.</p>

<p>Everything works fine in Firefox (3) &amp; Chrome, but fails in Internet Explorer, but only sometimes (certain actions, such as resetting the form, which really just does a response.redirect with some querystring parameters)... what happens in the Viewstate gets dumped on the URL, and an error page is thrown.</p>

<p>Has anybody come across this before?  Perhaps some pointers as to what might be causing this to occur in IE?</p>

<p>Thanks heaps,</p>

<p>greg</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>On further investigation, i have determined that the actual error is this:</p>

<p>""Validation of viewstate MAC failed. If this application is hosted by a Web Farm or cluster, ensure that  configuration specifies the same validationKey and validation algorithm. AutoGenerate cannot be used in a cluster. ""</p>

<p>Some more information that might help:  This is caused by a user control that is being hosted in a content management system (Umbraco), which might have something to do with why the viewstate is being passed to the page (as the control is contained within a greater page in the CMS).  I will investigate this a little further, but any other suggestions would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>cheers
greg</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong></p>

<p>Can anybody suggest why this only happens in IE (and not in FF or Chrome)??  Seems hardly likely its an issue with controls changing or machine keys or other suggestions I've read around the place, if other browsers can deal with it fine.  </p>

<p><strong>Any ideas what IE does differently that could cause this failure??</strong></p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></p>

<p>Turns out it was a really silly problem - I was using the wrong master template in the CMS, and therefore had 2 form tags.  Remove extra form tag, problem solved!</p>

<p>Thanks heaps to bendewey for helping me solve this problem (see the comments in bendewey's post).</p>

<p>Your idea of doing ""RemoveFieldRef and FieldRef it right back in"" would be the same as setting the properties ""Required"" and ""Default Value"" through the interface for the ""Document"" or inherited content types though your idea would help if we are building custom content types.</p>

<p>In one location someone places a set of images on their local server. In another location, someone else places a group of documents on their local server.

<p>Note added after Matt's comment about explicit/implicit:</p>

<p>I don't think implicit/explicit is the difference. In the code I posted, the change is explicit in both cases. An implicit conversion is what occurs when you assign a short to an int.</p>

<p>Note to Sklivvz:</p>

<p>I wanted confirmation that my suspicion of the looseness of Jesse Liberty's (otherwise usually lucid and clear) language was correct. I thought that Jesse Liberty was being a little loose with his language. I understand that casting is routed in object hierarchy--i.e., you can't cast from an integer to a string but you could cast from custom exception derived from System.Exception to a System.Exception. </p>

<p>It's interesting, though, that when you do try to cast from an int to a string the compiler tells you that it couldn't ""convert"" the value. Maybe Jesse is more correct than I thought! </p>

<p>Please note that I have already asked a similar question regarding the Xcode debugger <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/582412/xcode-debugger-code-window-does-not-match-stack-window"">here</a>, but I am reposting since I just learned that this is in fact not Xcode's fault, but a problem with GCC / ld / GDB.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> My project makes use of the following third-party libraries: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_DirectMedia_Layer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SDL</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boost_C%2B%2B_Libraries"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Boost</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WxWidgets"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wxWidgets</a>. I am not sure if this matters for this problem, but I just wanted to mention it just in case it does. </p>

<p>I've tried compiling an Xcode SDL project template and did not experience the same problem, so it must be due to something special in my project.</p>

<p><strong>Second Edit</strong>: As I just found out, I made a mistake while searching files with the string ""This is an automatically generated"". I just found several dozen files with the same string, all belonging to <a href=""http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FreeImage</a>, one of the third party libraries I am using. So, the problem seems to be related to FreeImage, but I am not still not sure how to proceed.</p>

<p>I like Linq to Sql and the idea of expressing data access logic (or CRUD operations in general) in your native development tongue rather than having to deal with the ""impedance mismatch"" between C# and SQL.  For example, to return an ObjectDataSource-compatible list of Event instances for a business layer, we use:</p>

<pre><code>return db.Events.Select(c =&gt; new EventData() { EventID = c.EventID, Title = c.Title })
</code></pre>

<p>If I were to implement this using old SQL-to-C# constructs, I'd have to create a Command class, add the EventID parameter (using a string to describe the ""@EventID"" argument), add the SQL query string to the Command class, execute the command, and then use (cast-type)nwReader[""FieldName""] to pull each returned field value and assign it to a member of a newly created instance of my EventData class (yuck).</p>

<p>So, <em>that</em> is why people like Linq/SubSonic/etc. and I agree.</p>

<p>However, in the bigger picture I see a number of things that are wrong.  My sense is that Microsoft also sees something wrong and that is why they are <a href=""http://codebetter.com/blogs/david.hayden/archive/2008/10/31/linq-to-sql-is-dead-read-between-the-lines.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">killing Linq to SQL</a> and trying to move people to Linq to Entities.  Only, I think that Microsoft is <em>doubling-down on a bad bet.</em></p>

<p>So, what is wrong?</p>

<p>The problem is that there are <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">architecture astronauts</a>, especially at Microsoft, who look at Linq to Sql and realize that it is not a true data management tool: there are still many things you cannot do easily of comfortably in C# and they aim to <em>fix it.</em>  You see this manifested in the ambitions behind Linq to Entities, blog posts about the <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/adioltean/archive/2005/09/13/465471.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">revolutionary</a> nature of Linq and even the <a href=""http://www.linqpad.net/Challenge.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">LinqPad challenge</a>.</p>

<p>And the problem with <em>that</em> is that it assumes that SQL is the problem.  That is, in order to reduce a mild discomfort (impedance mismatch between SQL and C#), Microsoft has proposed the equivalent of a space suit (full isolation) when a band-aid (Linq to SQL or something similar) would do just fine. </p>

<p>As far as I can see, developers are quite smart enough to master the relational model and then apply it intelligently in their development efforts.  In fact, I would go one further and say that Linq to SQL, SubSonic, etc. are <em>already too complex:</em> the learning curve isn't that much different from mastering SQL itself.  Since, for the foreseeable future, developers <em>must</em> master SQL and the relational model, we're now faced with learning <em>two</em> query / CRUD languages.  Worse yet, Linq is often difficult to test (you don't have a query window), removes us one layer from the real work we are doing (it generates SQL), and has very clumsy support (at best) for SQL constructs like Date handling (e.g. DateDiff), ""Having"" and even ""Group By"".</p>

<p>What is the alternative? Personally, I don't need a different model for data access like Linq to Entities.  I'd prefer to simply pop up a window in Visual Studio, enter and validate my SQL, and then press a button to generate or supplement a C# class to encapsulate the call.   Since you already know SQL, wouldn't you prefer to just enter something like this: </p>

<pre><code>Select EventID, Title From Events Where Location=@Location
</code></pre>

<p>and end up with an EventData class that A) contains the EventID and Title fields as properties and B) has a factory method that takes a 'Location' string as an argument and that generates a List&lt;EventData&gt;?  You'd have to think carefully about the object model (the above example obviously doesn't deal with that) but the fundamental approach of still using SQL while eliminating the impedance mismatch appeals to me a great deal.</p>

<p>The question is: am I wrong?  Should Microsoft rewrite the SQL infrastructure so that you don't have to learn SQL / relational data management any more?  <em>Can</em> they rewrite the SQL infrastructure in this way? Or do you think that a very thin layer on top of SQL to eliminate the pain of setting up parameters and accessing data fields is quite sufficient?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> I wanted to promote two links to the top because I think that they capture important aspects of what I am after.  First, CodeMonkey points out an article entitled <a href=""http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">""The Vietnam of Computer Science.""</a>  It takes a while to get started but is a very interesting read.  Second, AnSGri points to one of Joel Spolsky's more prominent pieces: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Law of Leaky Abstractions</a>. It isn't exactly on topic but it is close and is a great read.</p>

<p>Update 2: I've given the ""answer"" to ocdecio although there are many great answers here and the choice of the ""right"" answer is purely subjective. In this case, his answer squared with what I think is truly the best practice given the current state of technology.  This is an area that I fully expect to evolve, however, so things may well change.  I'd like to thank everyone who contributed, I've upvoted everyone who I think gave a thoughtful answer.</p>

<p>Now, after running into some problems, reading <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/137975/what-is-so-bad-about-singletons"">this</a> SO question, and especially <a href=""http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/singleton-considered-stupid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> blog post, I understand the evil that I have brought into the world.</p>

<p>So: How do I go about <i>removing</i> singletons from existing code?</p>

<p>For example:<br>
In a retail store management program, I used the MVC pattern. My Model objects describe the store, the user interface is the View, and I have a set of Controllers that act as liason between the two. Great. Except that I made the Store into a singleton (since the application only ever manages one store at a time), and I also made most of my Controller classes into singletons (one mainWindow, one menuBar, one productEditor...). Now, most of my Controller classes get access the other singletons like this:</p>

<pre><code>Store managedStore = Store::getInstance();
managedStore.doSomething();
managedStore.doSomethingElse();
//etc.
</code></pre>

<p>Should I instead:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create one instance of each object and pass references to every object that needs access to them?
<li>Use globals?
<li>Something else?
</ol>

<p>Globals would still be bad, but at least they wouldn't be <a href=""http://misko.hevery.com/2008/08/17/singletons-are-pathological-liars/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pretending</a>.</p>

<p>I see #1 quickly leading to horribly inflated constructor calls:</p>

<pre><code>someVar = SomeControllerClass(managedStore, menuBar, editor, sasquatch, ...)
</code></pre>

<p>Has anyone else been through this yet? What is the OO way to give many individual classes acces to a common variable without it being a global or a singleton? </p>

1. Custom build of the dojo library. (increased dojo.js from 240kb to 350kb)
2. Took all the static stuff out of the struts jar and kept it outside.</p>

<p>The performance was significantly improved. But still it is quite heavy as you can guess with 350kb size..</p>

<p>Is struts2 ajax supposed to be this heavy? or is there any lighter implementation available?</p>

<p>Edit: I used Firebug and YSlow with my application. Couple of changes that improved my situation hugely are mentioned below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Custom build of dojo (reduced the number of I/Os)</li>
<li>Move the static files out of Struts jar (helped a great deal)</li>
<li>tune your server to gzip the response (reduced the response size to 1/3)</li>
<li>Reduce number of images on your site.(this is obvious)</li>

<p>I've tried to read help about metaclasses but without big success.</p>

<p>Here example of what I'm doing.</p>

<pre><code>class Project(object):
  ""Base class and factory.""
  def __init__(self, url):
      if is_url_local(url):
        self.__class__ = ProjectLocal
      else:
        self.__class__ = ProjectRemote
      self.url = url

class ProjectLocal(Project):
  def do_something(self):
    # do the stuff locally in the dir pointed by self.url

class ProjectRemote(Project):
  def do_something(self):
    # do the stuff communicating with remote server pointed by self.url
</code></pre>

<p>Having this code I can create the instance of ProjectLocal/ProjectRemote via base class Project:</p>

<pre><code>project = Project('http://example.com')
project.do_something()
</code></pre>

<p>I know that alternate way is to using fabric function that will return the class object based on url, then code will looks similar:</p>

<pre><code>def project_factory(url):
      if is_url_local(url):
        return ProjectLocal(url)
      else:
        return ProjectRemote(url)

project = project_factory(url)
project.do_something()

<p>Is my first approach just matter of taste or it has some hidden pitfalls?</p>

<p>Then, my sample pages look like:</p>

#!/usr/bin/python

print ""html tags, more stuff, etc.""

<p>This works fine. But, I came across a comment in a post that said that <strong>CGI isn't the best way to use Python</strong>. Of course, it didn't mention what <em>is</em> the best way.</p>

<p><strong>Why is it that using CGI is not the best way to use Python? What is the alternative?</strong></p>

<p>Is there some <strong>totally other way</strong> to set up a simple Python site? Is there some completely different paradigm I should be looking at outside of .htaccess and .py files?</p>

<p>in  response to a question below: the information required to determine which controls to restore is contained in a dedicated viewstate object.</p>

<p>I am dynamically creating controls in the codebehind page - these controls are all hooked up to click handlers so when a postback occurs I must re-create the previous set of controls, then clear the controls down and generate the new set of controls based on the previous click.</p>

<p>This is coded and working correctly under normal circumstances esentially as follows:</p>

<pre><code>in Page_Load
if not postback generate default buttons 
else if postback re-generate buttons that were shown on last page

in click_handler
Clear the dynamically generated buttons created in the Page_Load
generate new buttons based on the specific click being handled
</code></pre>

<p>however when the server comes under load we start getting problems:</p>

<p>With 5 users per second we start getting the exception:
<strong>Multiple controls with the same ID 'add0' were found. FindControl requires that controls have unique IDs.</strong></p>

<p>With 100 users per second we start getting the exception:
<strong>The control collection cannot be modified during DataBind, Init, Load, PreRender or Unload phases.</strong></p>

<p>Once this occurs all subsequent requests get the same error and IIS has to be re-started.</p>

<p>What could be causeing this and how can I avoid it?  Do html requests possibly overwrite and interfere with each other when under load? do objects somehow hand around after a page unload in a manner that would allow the next page load to trip over them?</p>

<p>When I use this user control, how can I apply a CircleColor to the control, and have it be shown as the Ellipse's fill color? Even better... can I give it a default color that shows up in the VS2008 Designer?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
This is not homework, but a riddle posed on a <a href=""http://www.hacker.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">hacker.org</a>. The point is to implement XOR on a stack-based virtual machine with very limited operations (similar to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck"" rel=""noreferrer"">brainfuck</a> language and yes - no shift or mod). Using that VM is the difficult part, though of course made easier by an algorithm that is short and simple.</p>

For example, if UserDetails.aspx is used to edit and save a users information, if someone with inappropriate permissions enter the page, I would like to render it as read-only.  So, most controls would be converted to labels, loaded with the corresponding data from the editable original control.</p>

<p>I think it would likely be a fairly simple routine, ie:  </p>

<pre><code>Dim ctlParent As Control = Me.txtTest.Parent  
Dim ctlOLD As TextBox = Me.txtTest  
Dim ctlNEW As Label = New Label  
ctlNEW.Width = ctlOLD.Width  
ctlNEW.Text = ctlOLD.Text  
ctlParent.Controls.Remove(ctlOLD)  
ctlParent.Controls.Add(ctlNEW)

<p>...is really all you need for a textbox --> label conversion, but I was hoping someone might know of an existing function out there as there are likely a few pitfalls here and there with certain controls and situations.</p>

<p>Update:<br>
- Just setting the ReadOnly property to true is not a viable solution, as it looks dumb having things greyed out like that.
- Avoiding manually creating a secondary view is the entire point of this, so using an ingenious way to display a read only version of the user interface that was built by hand using labels is wat I am trying to avoid.</p>

<p>Is it possible to have a working copy on a network available share (c:\svn\projects\website) that everyone (in this case 3 of use) can checkout and commit files to? We don't need a build server because it is an asp site and the designers are used to having immediate results when they save a file. I could try and show them how to set it up local on their machines but if we could just share the files on the development server and still have the ability to commit when someone is done, that would be ideal.</p>

<p>An easy solution would be for all of us to use the same subversion username and that would at least allow me to put files under version control.</p>

<p>But is it possible to checkout a folder from the svn respository but still require each person to login with their user/pass to commit?</p>

<p>EDIT: I'm trying to take our current work flow, which is editing the LIVE version of a site using Frontpage Extensions or FTP. And move it to something BETTER. In this case a copy of the live site on a development server that I setup to mirror the live server, remove frontpage extensions access. Then the designers can still have the same effect of instant gratification but I will not have to worry they are editing the live files. Even using a shared user/pass in subversion is still version control. It may not be ideal and if the designers were actually programmers I would try to get them fully on board but that's just not the case. This is the best I can do in this case and avoid a huge learning curve and work stoppage.</p>

<p>Every other column in that table (that isn't of an XML datatype) updates perfectly fine, but when I went to make changes to the XML field, the program executes (seemingly) correctly, but the field always retains its original value after I run <code>SubmitChanges()</code>.</p>

<p>I looked around the internet and found a few posts on Microsoft Connect diagnosing similar problems and finally stumbled on the solution <a href=""https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/Workaround.aspx?FeedbackID=360433"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>

<p>To force XML field update this won't do:</p>

<pre><code>XElement tmp = MyLinqObject.XmlField;
MyLinqObject.XmlField = null;
MyLinqObject.XmlField = tmp;
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of that to force LINQ to update XML column assign a cloned object:</p>

<pre><code>MyLinqObject.XmlField = new XElement (MyLinqObject.XmlField);
</code></pre>

<p>I can confirm that this does indeed seem to work, but I'm not exactly sure why.  My only guess is that the XmlField Property has some sort of unique identifier on the heap and that by making a clone, you've assigned it a new unique identifier.  When Linq then generates the query, it doesn't even attempt to see if the field has been updated, since it has a new id, it simply write the value to the database.  But, I'm simply speculating and hope that someone else can provide a better understanding of what is going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: To address Jon's post, the reason for the issue (as it is explained on the MS Connect site) is that ""the XML field does not update because Linq-to-SQL doesn't handle the XElement.Changed event"".</p>

<p>For my implementation, the code that works ends up looking something like this:</p>

<pre><code>MyXElementProperty.SetElementValue(""Author"", author);

MyXElementProperty = new XElement(MyXElementProperty);
</code></pre>

<p>For reference (to anyone else that finds this question), the following also works:</p>

<pre><code>MyXElementProperty = new XElement(MyXElementProperty);

MyXElementProperty.SetElementValue(""Author"", author);

Substance absolutely refuses to construct UI classes outside of the EDT. I've done plenty of Swing/AWT and I know most of the rules regarding the EDT. I use SwingWorker, SwingUtilties.invokeLater to modify components. I always though that components could be <strong><em>CONSTRUCTED</em></strong> outside of the EDT, but must be <strong><em>realized</em></strong> and <strong><em>manipulated</em></strong> on the EDT. In other words, you can construct and setup defaults in the background but the call to pack/setVisible must be EDT as well as any subsequent calls to manipulate the component.</p>

<p>The reason I ask is that I have a particularly ""beefy"" window to construct, involving many widgets, state, and resources (lots of icons). Previously, I constructed the window on the background method of a SwingWorker and made the window visible in the done method. Never had a single problem. Upon switching to Substance, the internal EDT checking bites me.</p>

<p>I've been able to refactor code to get around this. I can construct on the EDT which isn't a good solution since the entire application will block. I can also refactor even more and try my best to load all of the extra resources outside of the EDT.</p>

<p>I have an MDI application (C#, Winforms, .NET 2.0, VS2005, DevExpress 8.2) and one of my forms is behaving very strangely - not repainting itself properly where it overlaps with another instance of the same form class.</p>

<p>The forms contain a custom control (which contains various DevExpress controls), and are inherited from a base form (which is itself inherited).</p>

<p>Due to issues with form inheritance (that old chestnut) there is a bit of control rearranging going on in the constructor. </p>

<p>Problem 1 (minor): None of this control repositioning/resizing seems to take effect unless the form is resized, so I nudge the width up and down by one pixel after the rearranging. Ugly, hacky and I'd really like to not have to do this.</p>

<p>Problem 2 (major): 
If forms are shown then attached to the MDI form using the API call SetParent, when I display the 2nd instance, various parts of the two forms are not correctly drawn where they overlap - bits of the top one are behind the existing one - and this problem gets worse when the forms are moved around, rendering them basically unuseable. Other child forms (if present) of a different type seem unaffected...</p>

<p>STOP PRESS: I've established that it doesn't have to be 2 instances of the child form. With only one there are still problems - mainly round the edges of the form, like the area that's being refreshed is smaller than the form itself.</p>

<p>The problem does not occur if the parent is set using the .MDIParent property of the child form - but we cannot do this as the form may be being displayed by a control hosted in a non-.Net application. Also I need to display the child forms non-maximised even if the existing children (of a different type) are maximised, and that only happens using SetParent.</p>

<p>I have tried Refresh() on all the forms of this type (I have a controller that keeps a list of them), but no joy. I have tried to reproduce this effect form a basic app with the same inheritance structure, but I can't. Clearly it is something about the form - since I recreated the form from scratch yesterday and it is still the same it must be the code - but what?? </p>

<p>I am not the hottest on form painting events etc. so have I missed something?</p>

<p>I have the following class <em>SubSim</em> which extends <em>Sim</em>, which is extending <em>MainSim</em>. In a completely separate class (and library as well) I need to check if an object being passed through is a type of <em>MainSim</em>. So the following is done to check;</p>

Type t = GetType(sim);

if (t != null)

<p>Obviously <em>t.BaseType</em> is going to return <em>Sim</em> since <em>Type.BaseType</em> gets the type from which the current Type directly inherits. </p>

<p>Short of having to do <em>t.BaseType.BaseType</em> to get <em>MainSub</em>, is there any other way to get the proper type using .NET libraries? Or are there overrides that can be redefined to return the main class? </p>

<li>Internet Explorer doesn't have new lines in their whitespace nodes, like they should.</li>
<li>Internet Explorer has no beginning whitespace node (there is obvious whitespace before the &lt;form&gt; tag, but no text node to match)
</ul>

<p>Of the tags in the test page, the following tags have no whitespace text nodes inserted in the DOM after them: <code>form</code>, <code>input[@radio]</code>, <code>div</code>, <code>span</code>, <code>table</code>, <code>ul</code>, <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>What is it about these nodes that makes them the exception in Internet Explorer?</strong>  Why is whitespace not inserted after these nodes, and is inserted in the others?  </p>

<p>This behavior is the same if you switch the tag order, switch the doctype to XHTML (while still maintaining standards mode).</p>

<p>Here's a <a href=""http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/wrongWithIE/?chapter=Empty+Space"" rel=""noreferrer"">link that gives a little background information</a>, but no ideal solution.  There might not be a solution to this problem, I'm just curious about the behavior.</p>

<p>Thanks Internet,

<p>So I limit my SQL with a TOP 1000.</p>

<p>Can I get that info without paying the price (or in other words, with still getting the speed benefits the ""top 1000"" is giving me ?)</p>

<p><strong>Assumptions</strong>
- Assume that the TOP 1000 brings 1000 out of <strong>100K</strong> rows. So even the network price of moving 100K might be an issue.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>
There is no free lunch! you can get the elegant way (accepted answer) but it still takes as long as the more expensive operation (i.e. counting all results). 
In real life, I will go with the 2 SQL approach, one to return top 1000 rows for display, and one that is ASYNC and updates some AJAX panel with the count(*) results that will take much much longer to computer</p>

BOOKING(property_id, start_date, end_date);

<p>Could you then easily construct a web page that showed a calendar of availability with periods that have been booked blanked out. Would it be easy to build reports from this database schema? Is it as easy as it seems?  </p>

<p>Calling the .Rules(""add"", therules) method only attaches the rules to elements that currently exist in the dom. If I were to create some. The validation doesn't fire. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Homepage of the validator I am using: <a href=""http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/</a></p>

<p>New elements are being created via <a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/</a></p>

<p>Basically there's an ajax call and the server returns a bunch of json (ajaj?), this json is fed through with the resig's templating engine. An example template looks like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/html"" id=""ProductsTemplateEdit""&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;input type=""hidden"" value=""&lt;#= item.ID #&gt;"" id=""Edit.ID"" name=""Edit.ID"" /&gt;

<p>The values are obviously filled in via the json that is passed in.</p>

<p>I should also mention that I am using the xval validation framework, which basically automatically generates the jquery validate rules for me: <a href=""http://blog.codeville.net/2009/01/10/xval-a-validation-framework-for-aspnet-mvc/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://blog.codeville.net/2009/01/10/xval-a-validation-framework-for-aspnet-mvc/</a></p>

Most of those seem to imply that a wx.ScrolledWindow should work if I just pass it a nested group of sizers(?):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most automatic and newest way is to simply let sizers determine the scrolling area.This is now the default when you set an interior sizer into a wxScrolledWindow with wxWindow::SetSizer. The scrolling area will be set to the size requested by the sizer and the scrollbars will be assigned for each orientation according to the need for them and the scrolling increment set by wxScrolledWindow::SetScrollRate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...but all the example's I've seen seem to use the older methods listed as ways to achieve scrolling. I've got something basic working, but as soon as you start scrolling you lose the child windows:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>After writing this I realized it becomes its own problem. The function is supposed to make information safe for HTML and SQL injection (there are other methods too, parameterized queries, etc but that's beside the point). However what happens, is that it first replaces <code>&amp;lt;</code> with <code>&amp; lt;</code>  and then proceeds to replace the newly written string again as every replace string has &amp;, # and ; signs in it.</p>

<p>Any hints? I thought about using a regex for this, but I couldn't find any decent Visual Basic examples that were simple enough.</p>

<p><b>Edit:</b> Thanks for the tips. I was sure there would be a ""smart"" easy way to do this, but I guess there are no common methods available after all. The re-arranging the problem cases first is the obvious solution here, thanks for that. I guess the work day was too long for me to notice. :D</p>

<p>As for parametirized queries, checking back I see my English doesn't come out as intended. I meant to say that I'm already using them, that this problem here is specific to prevent all manner of html-injection and possible sql-injection using the same strings elsewhere later. Thanks again for the help.</p>

<p>Sometimes when the user scrolls vertically through the control, extra grid lines are drawn, which looks terrible.</p>

<p>This does not happen when the slider or the mousewheel are used to scroll, only when the little down arrow button at the  bottom of the scroll control is used.</p>

<p>It seems that this occurs when the size of the list control window is not an exact even number of rows, so that a partial row is visible at the bottom.</p>

<p>If I adjust the size of the list control so that there is no partial rows visible, the problem is solved.  However, it will appear when the program is run on another computer, presumably because the number of pixels occupied by a row changes.  </p>

I just get a 404, no event log entries, nothing...</p>

<p>I noticed in the redistributable package information that:

<p>Is there a way to reinstall .Net 2.0, or somehow do whatever it is it does to IIS to make it work?</p>

<p>Edit: Minimizing would probably be better, but not sure how to do that either.  We do display a message informing the user that the process may take 10-20 minutes, however the problem is that the main setup form is completely frozen, can't move, minimize or do anything with it.

I'm finding myself particularly busy this semester, managing various tasks and timelines between work and school. Further, I find myself running around between labs, work, home, libraries, etc. For these reasons I think a web based solution is ideal. Which leads to the question, do you have a recommended web based solution for task/project management for personal use? Ideal would be free (or nearly), and one which I could install on my server. Accounting is not a requirement, just management of time and tasks (gantt charts would be great). However, svn integration would be really good as I keep my school work in there.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I put a bounty on this, as a good solution would be very valuable to me (more so than the rep). The answers so far have been great, but none fit just right for personal use. Ideal would be something that manages files and time with something I could self host. It would be a plus for MAC+PC solutions as we use MAC OSX in the lab on campus. Currently SVN and a web based time manager seems to be the way to go.</p>

Trac and Request Tracker are also free and self hosted, however, their strengths seem to lay in team development. I’m going to give FogBugz on Demand a shot and see how that works out. I am also going to start using the Drop Box as suggested, great idea!  Further, SVN <strong><em>will</em></strong> be used for the longevity of ‘everything’.  This should walk around the 2 gig issue and self hosting desire. I am considering SVNNotifier for keeping machines current. Thanks again!</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>I have decided to use <a href=""http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FogBugz</a> as suggested by Zabbala.  As he said, it really does everything I want from task tracking to time management.  It’s an amazing and generous free offering from FogCreek.  Thank you everyone, I really appreciate all of the feedback.</p>

<p><strong>FOLLOWUP</strong></p>

<p>Just to follow up on this item. I have been using FogBugz for two weeks now; couldn’t be happier. I have started using <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B001AAN4PW"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LiveScribe’s SmartPen</a> in conjunction with FogBugz. I am keeping longer term items within FogBugz, and copy the current week’s items in a ‘journal’ for the road. The SmartPen makes digitizing the 'journal' painless.</p>

<p>For managing files I am using a mixture between FogBugz, DropBox, SVN, and Unison. I use DropBox to share across the net, say between home and the lab, and Unison to synch up the DropBox folder within the larger SVN working copy (not everything is in DropBox).</p>

<p><strong>LONG TERM FOLLOW UP</strong></p>

<p>I've been using fogbugz much less in favor of the LiveScribe's journal. Seems that the traditional pen and paper has an efficiency to it that's hard to beat. Regarding LiveScribe, I have had a few problems with it which has left me uncomfortable with their file format. Their files are obscured in both the naming convention and the format. If they had an open format I would feel much better about entrusting it with my data.</p>

<p><strong><em>LONGER TERM FOLLOW UP (3 YEAR+)</em></strong></p>

<p>I've switched to using wikimedia to document my work/time/research. For task management I have been using the Google app <strong><em>Insightly</em></strong>. The combination feels more natural and has 'stuck'. The wiki route is really useful... </p>

<p><strong>*EVEN LONGER TERM FOLLOW UP (7 YEAR+) *</strong></p>

<p>I've switched to using Trello boards for task management.  I've drifted away from using wikimedia after a mistake on my part caused the database to be lost.</p>

At first, my app.config serviceModel section looked like this:</p>

&lt;/services&gt;

<p> </p>

<p>This works fine in development when I was accessing the service running on my local machine. When I deployed it, the WSDL contained absolute paths that still pointed to localhost:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsd:import schemaLocation=http://localhost:8888/MyService?xsd=xsd0 namespace=""http://tempuri.org/"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, I can change the httpGetUrl in the app.config like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled=""true"" httpGetUrl=http://devserver1:8888/MyService /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And now the wsdl works correctly on that server. The problem is that I have to manually set the address in each app.config that gets deployed.</p>

<p>Is there a way to either:<br>
1. Have the wsdl already include everything so that there are no imports?<br>
or<br>
2. Use relative paths in the wsdl import statements?<br></p>

<p>Or any other suggestions would be appreciated. I have two development servers that the deployment is automated to, if only it weren't for this wsdl problem.</p>

<p>Since this is only for generating the proxy, I suppose I could generate the proxy and distribute it myself, but I'd rather let users generate the proxy themselves.</p>

I've done some searching (both here, and in general), but can't find the answers (or even reasonable hints) to what I want to achieve (though, a few things come close-ish).</p>

<p>Basically, I'm trying to deserialize the data for the Google Chrome bookmarks file using the <a href=""http://james.newtonking.com/pages/json-net.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Json.NET library</a> (though, if there's a better alternative, I'm all for that - the documentation for this library is a little confusing in places).  I'm a little confused as to the next step to take, due primarily to being used to PHP's fantastic handling of JSON data (using <a href=""http://uk.php.net/json_decode"" rel=""noreferrer"">json_decode()</a>), allowing for a single function call, and then simple associative-array access.</p>

<p>The library (Json.NET) wants me to specify an Object type that it can deserialize the JSON data into, but I'm not really sure how to go about structuring such an Object, given the format of the Bookmarks file itself.  The format is something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>{

<p>Now, in PHP, I'd be far more used to doing something along the lines of the following, to get the data I wanted, and ending up with 'Json.NET':</p>

<pre><code>$data['roots']['bookmark_bar']['children'][0]['name'];
</code></pre>

<p>I can work out, simply enough, what objects to create to represent the data (something like a root object, then a bookmark list object, and finally an individual bookmark object) - but I'm really not sure as to how to implement them, and then get the library to deserialize into the relevant objects correctly.</p>

<p>Any advice that can be offered would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>My thinking is that this would be useful for both developers and project managers: project managers like to have a fairly broad overview of what is going on, whereas developers need to drill down to the details, and very often need to divide a task into sub-tasks. This would also come in handy if someone put two issues into one ticket.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of an issue tracker which does this? So far the ones I've looked at (Trac, FogzBugz, and Basecamp) all have a flat organisation of tickets, so they're either useful for the developers or for the project managers but not for both. <a href=""http://www.assembla.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Assembla</a> does allow a ticket to have child tickets (and multiple parent tickets) but it doesn't do a very good job of usability on this specific feature.</p>

<p>If there is such an issue tracker, has anyone used it for both developers and project managers, and if so, how much success did you have with it? Alternatively, is there a better approach that can be usable by both categories of users?</p>

So in the code below the first time the button is clicked the first message shows a integer value.
How come the second time it's clicked it doesn't show 3 but instead shows the same integer
value? It continues to show the same integer value each time I click the button. The value is different only when I stop and restart the program.
Where is 3 being stored as it looks like the same memory location is used each time the button is clicked in the same run of the program?</p>

Currently I am making use of large numbers of separate .png files with transparent backgrounds to represent the various sprites and different frames of animation that I need. Most 'real world' game development projects seem to make use of 'sprite sheets' which contain multiple sprites or frames of animation within a single file. Also, rather than making use of native image transparency support, people often nominate an arbitrary colour that does not appear in the sprite pallette to be the transparent colour. How does one manage a file like this programatically?</p>

   send(socket, (char*)(&amp;msgToSend), sizeof(msgToSend);

<blockquote>
  <p>The converse is not true. Casting a char* to a pointer of any type other than a char* and dereferencing it is usually in violation of the strict aliasing rule. </p>

<p>Does this mean that when I recv a char array, I can't reinterpret cast to a struct when I know the structure of the message:</p>

int main()
{

    // Ommiting make sure we have a complete message from the stream
    // but lets assume msgBuff[0]  has a complete msg, and lets interpret the msg

    // SAFE!?!?!?
    pointerToMsg = &amp;msgBuff[0];

    printf(""Got Msg: a: %i, b: %i"", pointerToMsg-&gt;a, pointerToMsg-&gt;b);
}

It's mostly a one-man job (maintain and expand the site). I'll have a 2-3 days transition period when the other programmer will show me the system. But from what I know, there is little documentation. Everything is in the code (which is kind of documented). Here is  what I'm planning to ask so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Explanation on the most complex elements of the system</li>
<li>Description of the overall architecture</li>
<li>Description of the support tools (IDE setup, unit tests, deployment

<li>Any book, website, podcast he used to influence the architecture of the

<ul>
<li>What have you done specifically to improve the performance of the system, and where is the bottleneck right now?</li>
<li>Related to that, what have you done regarding the security of the system? (what have you done, and where are the security holes right now)</li>

<p>One last thing: the developer said that he will be available to to answer my questions later on if I need it. It's his ""baby"" after all. But I really think that in 6 months he will have moved on and his availability will be much more reduced!</p>

<p>This is particularly annoying when I link to a file with an extension, as it breaks the link.</p>

<p>Any ideas why this is happening and how I can fix it?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
For those asking about my exact implementation, here it is. In my troubleshooting I've dumbed it down as much as I could, so please don't mind where I concat plain text to plaintext...</p>

    echo '&lt;div class=""listItem clearfix""&gt;';
    echo '&lt;div class=""info""&gt;';

    }
    echo '&lt;/span&gt;';
echo '&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;';
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
In response to Matt Long, I pasted in your line and it rendered the same.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
In response to Fire Lancer, I've put back in my original attempt, and will show you both below.</p>

<pre><code>echo substr($item[6],13) . '&lt;br&gt;';
echo '&lt;a href=""http://' . substr($item[6],13) . '"" title=""' . $item[0] . '""&gt;' . $item[0] . '&lt;/a&gt;';

</code></pre>

<p>The reason for the substr'ing is due to the URL being run through rawurlencode() elsewhere, and linking to http%3A%2F%2F makes the page think it is a local/relative link.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
I pasted the above response without really looking at it. So the HTML is correct when viewing source, but the actual page interprets it with another trailing slash after it.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
This was all a result of rawlurlencode(). If I decoded, or skipped the encoding all together, everything worked perfectly. Something about rawurlencode() makes the browser want to stick a trailing slash in there.</p>

<p>Take the numbers 0 to 9 and assign one or more letters to this number. For example:</p>

<pre><code>0 = N,
1 = L,
2 = T,
3 = D,
4 = R,
5 = V or F,
6 = B or P,
7 = Z,
8 = H or CH or J,
9 = G
</code></pre>

<p>When I have a code like 0123, it's an easy job to encode it. It will obviously make up the code NLTD. When a number like 5,6 or 8 is introduced, things get different. A number like 051 would result in more than one possibility:</p>

<p>NVL and NFL</p>

<p>It should be obvious that this gets even ""worse"" with longer numbers that include several digits like 5,6 or 8.</p>

<p>Being pretty bad at mathematics, I have not yet been able to come up with a decent solution that will allow me to feed the program a bunch of numbers and have it spit out all the possible letter combinations. So I'd love some help with it, 'cause I can't seem to figure it out. Dug up some information about permutations and combinations, but no luck.</p>

<p>Thanks for any suggestions/clues. The language I need to write the code in is PHP, but any general hints would be highly appreciated.</p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>Some more background: (and thanks a lot for the quick responses!)</p>

<p>The idea behind my question is to build a script that will help people to easily convert numbers they want to remember to words that are far more easily remembered. This is sometimes referred to as ""pseudo-numerology"".</p>

<p>I want the script to give me all the possible combinations that are then held against a database of stripped words. These stripped words just come from a dictionary and have all the letters I mentioned in my question stripped out of them. That way, the number to be encoded can usually easily be related to a one or more database records. And when that happens, you end up with a list of words that you can use to remember the number you wanted to remember.</p>

<p>I need to poll the database and based on a result, create a request to the database for more data, get the response and pass it to a group of ports, for which based on a promoted property, only one of the ports will act.</p>

<p>It looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XUZt2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XUZt2.jpg"" width=""620""></a>
</p>

<p>However, if you assign ""Temp Out"" to a send port group, the message is sent to all the ports in the group, irregardless of the filters set on each port.  From my understanding, this is expected behavior (read <a href=""http://www.biztalkgurus.com/forums/t/2236.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>).</p>

<p>So I explored other options such as using Content Based Routing (CBR sample) like in the SDK. You can view this <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms948408.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. </p>

<p>I tried this and completely removed the orchestration (its really not needed).  However, there are major routing/subscription errors, and upon further research, it appears that you can't do this if you have solicit-response ports.  Some articles on that <a href=""http://www.tech-archive.net/Archive/BizTalk/microsoft.public.biztalk.general/2006-02/msg00178.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.   I pretty much have the same issue <a href=""http://www.biztalkgurus.com/forums/t/5016.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> user does.</p>

<p>In the end it doesn't matter to me whether I use an orchestration or not.  However, I need a solution in which I can pass the message to multiple send ports, and I can have only one actually use the message and send.  This is needed so that I can edit and add ports easily without having to modify anything else or hard code decisions into the orchestration.</p>

<p>Near as I can tell, the only way to create a distribution list in the GAL is via the exchange management tools.  Without installing this on our web server, is there any way to create a distribution list remotely?  There are some third party components that allow you to create personal distribution lists, but these only live in a users Contacts folder and are not available to all users within the company.</p>

<p>Ideally there would be some kind of web services call to exchange or an API we could work with.  The Exchange SDK provides the ability to managing Exchange data (e.g. emails, contacts, calendars etc.).  There doesn't appear to be an Exchange management API.</p>

<p>It looks like the distribution lists are stored in AD as group objects with a special Exchange attributes, but there doesn't seem to be any documentation on how they are supposed to work.  </p>

<p>Edit: We could reverse engineer what Exchange is doing with AD, but my concern is that with the next service pack of Exchange this will all break.  </p>

<p>What I mean is something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are two 2 servers: <em>Server1</em> and <em>Server2</em></li>
<li>Both server host database <em>Foo</em> and both instances of <em>Foo</em> are identical</li>
<li>I connect to Server1 and submit a complicated (lots of joins, many calculations) query</li>
<li><em>Server1</em> decides that some calculations should be made on <em>Server2</em> and some data should be read from that server, too - appropriate parts of the query are sent to <em>Server2</em></li>
<li>Both servers read data and perform necessary calculations</li>
<li>Finally, results from <em>Server1</em> and <em>Server2</em> are merged and returned to the client</li>
</ul>

<p>All this should happen <strong>automatically</strong>, without need to explicitly reference <em>Server1</em> or <em>Server2</em>. I mean such parallel query execution - is it possible?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for the tips, John and wuputah.</p>

<p>I am researching alternatives of increasing <strong>both</strong> availability and capacity of MOSS database backend. So what I'm looking for is some kind out-of-the-box SQL Server load balancing solution that would be <strong>transparent to the application</strong>, because I <strong>cannot modify the application</strong> in any way. <strong>I guess SQL Server has no such feature</strong> (and Oracle, as far as I understand it, does - it is RAC mentioned by wuputah).</p>

<p>A quote from the <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.03.sqlclusters.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Top Tips for SQL Server Clustering</a> article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let's start by debunking a common
  misconception. You use MSCS clustering
  for high availability, not for load
  balancing. Also, SQL Server does not
  have any built-in, automatic
  load-balancing capability. You have to
  load balance through your
  application's physical design.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM: my solution was a base form that provided OK and CANCEL buttons to emit Completed and Cancelled events; OK called a virtual ValidateData for subclass override. The calling form used properties to avoid recreating the form each time (the form was just hidden instead of closed) and kept a dictionary of active forms to prevent the same form from being activated more than once. This looks like a modal form, supports multiple pop-up forms at once, but does not tie up the main GUI thread.</p>

<p>I need to iterate through the array and find the range (the largest value in the array minus the smallest value). However, there is a catch. I only want to find the range where the smallest and largest values are within 1,000 samples of each other.</p>

<p>So I need to find the maximum of: range(data + 0, data + 1000), range(data + 1, data + 1001), range(data + 2, data + 1002), ...., range(data + 3599000, data + 3600000).</p>

<p>I hope that makes sense. Basically I could do it like above, but I'm looking for a more efficient algorithm if one exists. I think the above algorithm is O(n), but I feel that it's possible to optimize. An idea I'm playing with is to keep track of the most recent maximum and minimum and how far back they are, then only backtrack when necessary.</p>

<p>I'll be coding this in C++, but a nice algorithm in pseudo code would be just fine. Also, if this number I'm trying to find has a name, I'd love to know what it is.</p>

There are a few complications:
1) The file may be in use
2) The files can be quite large (100mb+)
3) Each entry may be multi-line</p>

<p>To solve the in-use issue, I need to copy it first. I'm currently copying it directly from the remote machine to the local machine, and parsing it there. That leads to issue 2. Since the files are quite large copying it locally can take quite a while.</p>

<p>To enhance parsing time, I'd like to make the parser multi-threaded, but that makes dealing with multi-lined entries a bit trickier. </p>

<p>The two main issues are:
1) How do i speed up the file transfer (Compression?, Is transferring locally even neccessary?, Can I read an in use file some other way?)
2) How do i deal with multi-line entries when splitting up the lines among threads?</p>

<p>The users for both sections are different so they require a different login page. I wanted to configure the authentication differently for both folders, but ASP.Net but it's not allowed.</p>

<p>Example (in my main web.config):</p>

    &lt;forms loginUrl=""~/Pages/Internal/Main.aspx"" defaultUrl=""~/Pages/Internal/Main.aspx"" cookieless=""UseDeviceProfile"" name="".ApplicationAuthenticatedUser"" path=""/"" protection=""All"" slidingExpiration=""true"" timeout=""45""/&gt;

<p>I tried putting both of them in their subfolders but I get the same error, the authentication configuration section must be set at the application level (I'm guessing that means the root web.config).</p>

<p>A possible solution is to centralize the login page and redirect depending on where the request came from, if it came from an external page, send it to the external login page, otherwise to the internal one.</p>

The feature looks kind of like partial classes in C# - is this exclusively behind-the-scenes compiler functionality, or is it something I could use myself?</p></li>
<li><p>The BindableProperty class still does not explicitly implement EventDispatcher, how does the generated class implement event dispatching?</p></li>

<p>I have read that this is typically the fault of missing libraries. I know the C &amp; FORTRAN code compiles fine seperatly (respective libraries included) as does the C++ code when compiled on its own. This leads me to believe that it is the interface between the two programs that causes the error. Unfortunatly I've little to no experiance debugging this sort of problem and without any clues from the linker its hard to move forward. I'll include the necessary parts of my program that deal with the interface between the two sides of the program.</p>

<p>First the C++ part: SA.h, SA.cpp</p>

<p>SA.h:</p>

<pre><code>class SimAnneal {
    ...
    std::vector&lt;float&gt; DensityArray; 
    std::vector&lt;float&gt; EnergyArray;
  public
    double ObjFunction ();
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>SA.ccp:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;          
#include &lt;time.h&gt;           
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include ""SA.h""
#include ""CFE.h""
#include ""randomc.h""  //Includes mersenne.cpp

double SimAnneal::ObjFunction () 
{
    CFE(&amp;DensityArray[0], &amp;EnergyArray[0]); 

      // sends pointers of both arrays to CFE.c and modifies EnergyArray as 
      // shown in CFE.c

    double SumStrainEnergy = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; EnergyArray.size(); i++)
    {
        SumStrainEnergy += EnergyArray[i];  //Effectively sum of array 
                                                //engy[] from CFE.c
    }

    return SumStrainEnergy;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly the C/FORTRAN part: CFE.h, CFE.c</p>

<p>CFE.h:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef __cplusplus
extern ""C"" {
#endif 

void CFE(float density[], float energy[]);

#ifdef __cplusplus
 }
#endif 
</code></pre>

<p>CFE.c:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include ""BCs.h""
#include ""EMatrix.h""
#include ""Numbering.h""
#include ""KMatrix.h""
#include ""fg_types.h""
#include ""Solve.h""

void CFE(float density[], float energy[])
{
    ...stuff...

    float * dens;
    dens = density;  //pass pointer of array density[0] in SA.cpp to CFE.c

    ...more stuff....

    float * engy;
    engy = energy; //pass pointer of array energy[0] in SA.cpp to CFE.c

    ***Modify engy in some respects****    
}
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially the ObjFunction in SA.cpp is called in main.cpp, which contains main().</p>

<p>Is there any visible fault?</p>

<p>Is there any way I can ask the linker to announce what causes / where the error occours in the linking?</p>

<p>Any help will be much appriciated.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>This method is used by Importing (in VB.NET) System.Data.DataTableExtensions and then calling the method against an IEnumerable. You would do this if you want to filter a Datatable using LINQ, and then restore the DataTable at the end.</p>

<p>i.e:</p>

<pre><code>Imports System.Data.DataRowExtensions
    Imports System.Data.DataTableExtensions

    Public Class SomeClass
            Private Shared Function GetData() As DataTable
                Dim Data As DataTable

                Data = LegacyADO.NETDBCall


                Data = Data.AsEnumerable.Where(Function(dr) dr.Field(Of Integer)(""SomeField"") = 5).CopyToDataTable()


                Return Data

            End Function
    End Class
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, the ""WHERE"" filtering might return no results. If this happens CopyToDataTable throws an exception because there are no DataRows.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>The correct behavior should be to return a DataTable with Rows.Count = 0.</p>

<p>Can anyone think of a clean workaround to this, in such a way that whoever calls CopyToDataTable doesn't have to be aware of this issue?</p>

<p>System.Data.DataTableExtensions is a Static Class so I can't override the behavior....any ideas? Have I missed something?</p>

The library is written in C and was developed under Unix/Linux, and my application will run on Windows. It's a library of mostly mathematical functions, so as far as I can tell it doesn't use anything that's platform-dependent, it's just very basic C code. Also, it's not that big, less than 5,000 lines.</p>

<p>What's the easiest way to use the library in my application? I know there's JNI, but that involves finding a compiler to compile the library under Windows, getting up-to-date with the JNI framework, writing the code, etc. Doable, but not that easy. Is there an easier way? Considering the small size of the library, I'm tempted to just translate it to Java. Are there any tools that can help with that?</p>

<p><BR>
<strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I ended up translating the part of the library that I needed to Java. It's about 10% of the library so far, though it'll probably increase with time. C and Java are pretty similar, so it only took a few hours. The main difficulty is fixing the bugs that get introduced by mistakes in the translation.</p>

<p>Thank you everyone for your help. The proposed solutions all seemed interesting and I'll look into them when I need to link to larger libraries. For a small piece of C code, manual translation was the simplest solution.</p>

The only such interface I'm familiar with is the dialogue box found in Excel under data > sort, but this is rather clunky and does not yield itself to quick switching between views. I would much prefer an iTunes-style interface that allows quick sorting by clicking on column headers. However, such interfaces typically only allow sorting by one column (an exception is iTunes itself which has a very limited, apparently hard-coded ability to sort by ""Album by Artist"" and ""Album by Year"" by clicking on the Album header).</p>

<p>I can envision an interface where each column header has some numbers, such that clicking on 1 makes the column the primary sort key, clicking on 2 the secondary key, and so on. Alternatively, clicking (or right-clicking) on a column header could bring a drop-down menu with ""primary sort"", ""secondary sort"" etc. However, I've never seen such an interface implemented, and I don't have a good intuition of usability issues that may arise.</p>

<p>Are there applications that allow sorting by multiple columns using the column headers? Would you be able to point me to these? Are there any useful usability results regarding such interfaces -- which work better, which less so? </p>

<p>Also, while I am mostly interested in the specification of the interface, any hints to pass on to the people implementing it would be appreciated, e.g. publicly available libraries that provide parts of a solution (especially Java).</p>

<p>Edit: Two people have suggested using an Excel-style dialogue box. This is not going to work. For my application, users need to find the ""best match"" among existing table entries (which is often not a perfect match). The table is too big to keep in your head, so you need to keep scanning the relevant parts, and it's useful to repeatedly sort the table in order to get multiple views. Having to go through a dialogue box with multiple options for each change of view is just too slow; by the time you're done with the box, you've forgotten the results from the previous view.</p>

So, I need a mechanism to detect infinite loops and avoid executing that code in bf.<br>
One obvious (trivial) case is when I have</p>

<pre><code>[]
</code></pre>

<p>I can detect this and refuse to run that program.<br>
For the non-trivial cases, I figured out that the basic idea is: to determine how one iteration of the loop changes the current cell. If the change is negative, we're eventually going to reach 0, so it's a finite loop. Otherwise, if the change is non-negative, it's an infinite loop.<br>
Implementing this is easy for the case of a single loop, but with nested loops it becomes very complicated. For example, (in what follows (1) refers to contents of cell 1, etc. )</p>

<pre><code>++++ Put 4 in 1st cell (1)
&gt;+++ Put 3 in (2)
&lt;[   While( (1) is non zero)
    --   Decrease (1) by 2
    &gt;[   While( (2) is non zero)
        -    Decrement (2)
        &lt;+   Increment (1) 
    &gt;]   
    (2) would be 0 at this point
    +++  Increase (2) by 3 making (2) = 3
&lt;]   (1) was decreased by 2 and then increased by 3, so net effect is increment
</code></pre>

<p>and hence the code runs on and on. A naive check of the number of +'s and -'s done on cell 1, however, would say the number of -'s is more, so would not detect the infinite loop.<br>
Can anyone think of a good algorithm to detect infinite loops, given arbitrary nesting of arbitrary number of loops in bf?</p>

<p>EDIT: I do know that the halting problem is unsolvable in general, but I was not sure whether there did not exist special case exceptions. Like, maybe Matlab might function as a Super Turing machine able to determine the halting of the bf program. I might be horribly wrong, but if so, I would like to know exactly how and why. </p>

<p>SECOND EDIT: I have written what I purport to be infinite loop detector. It probably misses some edge cases (or less probably, somehow escapes Mr. Turing's clutches), but seems to work for me as of now. 
In pseudocode form, here it goes:</p>

<pre><code>subroutine bfexec(bfprogram)
begin
    Looping through the bfprogram,
        If(current character is '[')
            Find the corresponding ']'
            Store the code between the two brackets in, say, 'subprog'
            Save the value of the current cell in oldval
            Call bfexec recursively with subprog
            Save the value of the current cell in newval
            If(newval &gt;= oldval)
                Raise an 'infinite loop' error and exit
            EndIf
        /* Do other character's processings */
        EndIf
    EndLoop
end

Originally each function made a call to <code>memcache_connect()</code>, however that was unnecessary, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>mc-&gt;insert()  
mc-&gt;get()  
mc-&gt;delete() 
</code></pre>

<p>would make three memcache connections. I worked around this by creating a construct for the class:</p>

<pre><code>function __construct() {
    $this-&gt;mem = memcache_connect( ... );
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then using <code>$this-&gt;mem</code> wherever the resource was needed, so each of the three functions use the same <code>memcache_connect</code> resource.</p>

<p>This is alright, however if I call the class inside other classes, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>class abc
{
    function __construct() {
        $this-&gt;mc = new cache_class;

class def

<p>I can do this with globals but I would prefer not to use them if I don't have to.</p>

<p>Example globals implementation:</p>

<pre><code>$resource = memcache_connect( ... );

<p>The DocumentInfoService class implements a contract interface that has methods that invoke business objects requiring initialization (actually a connection string).

<p>However, the ServiceHost constructor takes a System.Type object -- so instances of DocumentInfoService are created via the default constructor.  I did note that there is another constructor method for ServiceHost that takes an object instance -- but the docs indicate that is for use with singletons.</p>

To this end, I'm looking for the equivalent of what I would have thought would be ControllerContext.Current but isn't.  Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit for clarification:</strong> I've got a generic form control which is JavaScript-based but I'd like to add an option so that it works with noscript.  At the moment my Controller sets the ViewData.Model to a JSON-ified Models.FormResponse&lt;T&gt;.</p>

<p>This FormReponse is set up with the status of the post and any error messages that were generated, so I'd like a GetActionResult() method which does the script/noscript check (a hidden form input) and either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sets the Model to the JSONed FormResponse and returns a View(), or</li>
<li>Serializes the FormResponse to the Session and returns a Redirect().</li>
</ol>

<p>As this obviously changes the return value and I don't want to do the check myself every time, I need to call View or Redirect from the FormResponse's GetActionResult method in order to call this as:</p>

<pre><code>return formResponse.GetActionResult();

<p>I know with a more astronautical design this could be made even more robust but as the noscript option is not a major feature at the moment, I just need to get a quick solution working that doesn't break other things.</p>

<p>What I want to do is create a medium-size table from scratch in Javascript. Say, 300 rows, 10 cells each. It takes at about 5-6 seconds on my computer to do this. OK, granted, it's a 5 year old rig, but that's still too much. Here's my dummy code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
      function MakeTable(parent)
      {
        var i, j;
        var table = document.createElement('table');
        var insertRow = table.insertRow;
        for ( i = 0; i &lt; 300; i++ )
        {
          var row = insertRow(-1);
          for ( j = 0; j &lt; 10; j++ )
          {
            var cell = row.insertCell(-1);
            cell.innerHTML = i + ' -  ' + j;
          }
        }
        parent.appendChild(table);
      }

&lt;/html&gt;

"446986","1","447061","","2009-01-15 14:41:11","","2","5704","<p>I'm writing a very simple flash app (AS 2) to sign users up to an email newsletter; the way it works is that it uses LoadVars to hit a (same-domain) PHP script via POST with the user's email address. The PHP script then passes the info through to another domain (the newsletter mailer URL) via curl to sign up the user.</p>

<p>So far, so good, and it works on roughly 70% of the computers on which it's been tested (it's being tested live from the website, not locally). However, on some computers, it doesn't appear that the LoadVars.sendAndLoad call is being made, as the email addresses sent from those computers aren't showing up on the subscriber list. I know that the PHP script still works on those computers as I've made a barebones HTML form that acts in exactly the way the Flash app does (POSTs to same PHP script with same variables, etc) and it works on all computers.</p>

<p>Here's the relevant AS:</p>

<pre><code>submit_btn.onRelease = function(){
    submitOutAnimation();
    this.enabled = false;
    var sendvar_lv:LoadVars = new LoadVars();
    var loadvar_lv:LoadVars = new LoadVars();
    loadvar_lv.onLoad = function(success:Boolean){
        gotoAndStop(""successful"");
    }
    sendvar_lv.email = entryField_mc.myAdd.text;
    sendvar_lv.sendAndLoad(""http://notmyrealdomainname.com/passthrough.php?ck=""+new Date().getTime(),loadvar_lv,""POST"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Could this be a security problem with the Flash client settings? Do you have any other ideas?  I've been under the impression that there isn't much variation in Flash playback across different computers (other than performance) assuming they have the same flash player version, and this experience is shattering that illusion...</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
It looks like using msbuild instead of devenv is probably the right way to go (as per Jay's comment).</p>

<p>Using msbuild the makeprg would be:</p>

<pre><code>:set makeprg=msbuild\ /nologo\ /v:q
</code></pre>

<p>Sample output whould be:</p>

<pre><code>Controller\FieldFactory.cs(14,19): error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'IFieldNothing' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like the tricky part here may lie in the fact that the path is relative to the .csproj file, not the .sln file which is the current directory in Vim and lies one directory above the .csproj file.</p>

<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>
I figured it out...</p>

<pre><code>set errorformat=\ %#%f(%l\\\,%c):\ %m
</code></pre>

<p>This will capture the output for both devenv /Build and msbuild.
However, msbuild has one catch.  By default, it's output doesn't include full paths.  To fix this you have to add the following line to your csproj file's main PropertyGroup:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;GenerateFullPaths&gt;True&lt;/GenerateFullPaths&gt;

Everything works fine except when I set the TEXT property of a button. For some reason, the click event is called...</p>

<p>Here's some of the code I've got:</p>

<pre><code>string controlName, value, property;
Control currentControl = null;
System.Reflection.PropertyInfo propertyInfo = null;

// run through all rows in the table and set the property
foreach (DataRow r in languageDataset.Tables[_parentForm.Name].Rows)
{
  controlName = r[""ControlName""].ToString().ToUpper();
  value = r[""Value""].ToString();
  property = r[""Property""].ToString();

  // check all controls on the form
  foreach (Control c in formControls)
  {
    // only change it if its the right control
    if (c.Name.ToUpper() == controlName)
    {
      propertyInfo = c.GetType().GetProperty(property);

      if (propertyInfo != null)
        propertyInfo.SetValue(c, value, null);  ******Calls Event Handler?!?!******
      //

      currentControl = c;
      break;
    }
  }

<p>So why in the world would it call the event handler when setting the value? Here's what I'm setting it with that's causing this:</p>

<p>My application has as a base the Utility Application template available in Xcode with the iPhone SDK. Currently I have some controls, such as an <code>UISlider</code> and text box, in the <code>FlipsideView</code>. The <code>UISlider</code> already has a method which is being called when the value changes, using targets and selectors. However, I would also like to be able to read, from the <code>MainView</code>, the current (or last) value of the <code>UISlider</code> and <code>textbox</code>.</p>

<p>Keep in mind I am new to development on a Mac, and would appreciate any guidance as to where I should look up such information, be it through the use of delegates or perhaps I am missing something obvious in the structure of the template.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
I am taking a look at the structure and have some more details: The <code>UISlider</code> is being created in <code>FlipsideView.m</code>. I noticed that the Done button is created from <code>RootViewController.m</code> and probably I should move the <code>UISlider</code> code over there. I may incorrectly be using the <code>View</code> to keep code that would be more appropiate in a Controller.</p>

<p>I built the system originally to walk through the array and find the max the usual way, by comparing the value at the current position to a recorded max-so-far, and updating a position variable when the max-so-far changes.  This worked well, an O(n) algo that was very simple.  I later learned that I need to keep not only the top value, but the top three or four.  I extended the same procedure and complicated the max-so-far into an array of four max-so-fars and now the code is ugly.  </p>

<p>It still works and is still sufficiently fast because only a trivial amount of computations have been added to the procedure.  it still effectively walks across the array and checks each value once.</p>

<p>I do this in MATLAB with a sort function that returns two arrays, the sorted list and the accompanying original position list.  By looking at the first few values I have exactly what I need.  I am replicating this functionality into a C# .NET 2.0 program.  </p>

<p>I know that I could do something similar with a List object, and that the List object has a built in sort routine, but I do not believe that it can tell me the original positions, and those are really what I am after.  </p>

<p>It has been working well, but now I find myself wanting the fifth max value and see that rewriting the max-so-far checker that is currently an ugly mess of if statements would only compound the ugliness.  It would work fine and be no slower to add a fifth level, but I want to ask the SO community if there is a better way.  </p>

<p>Sorting the entire list takes many more computations than my current method, but I don't think it would be a problem, as the list is 'only' one or two thousand floats; so if there is a sort routine that can give back the original positions, that would be ideal.</p>

<p>As background, this array is the result of a Fourier Transform on a kilobyte of wave file, so the max values' positions correspond to the sample data's peak frequencies.  I had been content with the top four, but see a need to really gather the top five or six for more accurate sample classification.</p>

What I'd like to try and do is have the query form at the top of the page, the user press Submit and the results show up in a YUI DataTable below the query form.</p>

<p>Normally, of course, on a HTML form the user presses Submit, the request gets sent to the server, and I use Struts to process it and then forward the request to a JSP and HTML gets sent back to the browser. That's what I do on a daily basis. With Ajax, I understand it's different in that I should return XML instead. Not a problem. Easy to do.</p>

<p>The questions I have deal with the YUI side of things. When the Submit button is pressed, what happens? Not normal form submission, right? Do I implement an onSubmit() JavaScript function which then triggers some YUI DataSource to go fetch the data? How do the request params get passed? Hopefully I don't have to construct the request manually. I'm guessing that I use a YAHOO.util.XHRDataSource and that's the DataSource for the DataTable.</p>

<p>I've managed to get the YUI DataTable to work using an HTML table element. Now I just need to switch it over to real data. Curiously, the YUI documentation seems a bit weak here, unless I'm missing something. Maybe this is just basic Ajax that the YUI docs don't cover?</p>

<p>I wrote kind of a hacked-together version for myself, but I'd like something that throttles itself somewhat smartly and can pick up where it left off if interrupted.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I eventually broke down and got out my credit card and signed up for a <em>real</em> bulk email service, and damn was that the right choice. The resulting emails are very professional, they have built-in analytics, also integrate with Google Analytics, and it's awesome for a ton of other reasons.</p>

<p>If you're looking to do bulk emails with Rails, I would suggest using the <a href=""http://mailchimp.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mailchimp</a> service (here's my <a href=""http://mailchimp.com/?aid=43f492c80ae71fa07dfae4d64&amp;afl=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">affiliate link</a> that has a bonus on signup) along with the <a href=""http://github.com/bgetting/hominid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hominid gem</a>.  This will allow you to sync all your user emails from your database to Mailchimp, then use a real bulk service instead of some crappy patched together one.</p>

<p><strong>Another Update</strong>: I heard about <a href=""http://sandglaz.com/blog_posts/25-Maktoub-a-simple-newsletter-engine-%20for-Rails"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maktoub</a> today, and it's pretty much exactly what I was describing. Disclaimer: I have never used it and would still probably steer clear and go with a paid service, but it's still probably better than rolling you own.</p>

I'd use Immediate window for that, but although it allows to execute methods on objects, it seems not to allow execute custom loop statements.</p>

<p>Simplest example in ASP.NET:</p>

<pre><code>this.Page.Validate();
if (!this.Page.IsValid())
{
  // breakpoint here
}
</code></pre>

<p>How can we iterate <code>Page.Validators</code> collection and find those which are invalid + output their information at that breakpoint? (this is not the main question, it's just a sample)</p>

<p>If it's not possible to do it straight forward, do you have any workarounds for this? Workarounds which would not involve code modification, just writing code in Immediate window or some Watch expression.</p>

<p>While googling I've found just one workaround quoted <a href=""http://visualstudiohacks.com/articles/ask-the-pros/ask-the-pros-debugging/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> (although could not find the original):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Add a debug method to your code that
  does something like iterate through
  all the objects in a collection. Then
  you can call that method from the
  immediate window while in debug mode
  and it will enumerate various things
  for you. Think of it like a
  command-line-debugger-helper. You can
  write as many of those as you like.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it's still a workaround. I image it should be doable without too much hacking and more importantly without modifying code.
Of course it should be possible to do some kind of collection transformations in one statement.</p>

<p>And let's stick to non-generic collections.
Also Immediate window seems not to accept lambda expressions (got an error when tried: ""Expression cannot contain lambda expressions"")</p>

<p>I can manually run a series of operations in the debugger I wrote, but I'd like to load a NES rom and just point the program counter at its instructions, I figured that this would be the fastest way to find flawed opcodes.</p>

<p>I wrote a quick NES rom loader and loaded the ROM banks into the CPU memory.</p>

<p>The problem is that I don't know how the opcodes are encoded. I know that the opcodes themselves follow a pattern of one byte per opcode that uniquely identifies the opcode, </p>

<pre><code>0 - BRK
1 - ORA (D,X)
2 - COP b
</code></pre>

<p>etc</p>

<p>However I'm not sure where I'm supposed to find the opcode argument. Is it the the byte directly following? In absolute memory, I suppose it might not be a byte but a short. </p>

<p>Is anyone familiar with this CPU's memory model?</p>

<p>EDIT: I realize that this is probably shot in the dark, but I was hoping there were some oldschool Apple and Commodore hackers lurking here.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thanks for your help everyone. After I implemented the proper changes to align each operation the CPU can load and run Mario Brothers. It doesn't do anything but loop waiting for Start, but its a good sign :)</p>

<p>I uploaded the source:</p>

<p><a href=""https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=cpu6502"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=cpu6502</a></p>

<p>If anyone has ever wondered how an emulator works, its pretty easy to follow. Not optimized in the least, but then again, I'm emulating a CPU that runs at 2mhz on a 2.4ghz machine :)</p>

<p>my user model has many relations (details, addresses, roles...) who get loaded with eager loading. That creates really huge SQL queries, for some cases, it takes almost a minute to load 30 users. On the other hand removing the eager loading generates hundreds of queries, in the end I have the same problem: loading the page is slow.</p>

<p>I used to develop on Java &amp; Oracle, for this kind of big queries I used to create views, those views were then cached for a faster rendering. It was extremely boring to maintain, as I had to update the database fields manually in the views scripts etc...</p>

<p>BUT it really had fantastic performances.... so I was wondering if anyone ever tried to implement something to take benefits of Mysql views in active record ?</p>

<p>I just did some basic tests, here's my view (just a few fields for the example, I have a standard Restful Authentication user table, and a big table ""details"" for the personal datas ):</p>

<pre><code>CREATE VIEW users_vs AS SELECT
users.id              ,          
users.login           ,          
users.email           ,          
details.last_name           ,
details.first_name          ,
details.phone               ,
details.fax                 ,
FROM `users`   LEFT OUTER JOIN `details` ON details.user_id = users.id ;
</code></pre>

<p>Then a model:</p>

<pre><code>class UsersV &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end
</code></pre>

<p>Tried a few things in my console:</p>

<pre><code>u=UsersV.find(:first)  # ok !
u=UsersV.find_by_last_name('smith') #=&gt; ok !
us=UsersV.find_all_by_last_name('smith') #=&gt; ok too !
</code></pre>

<p>looking at the log, simple queries are just handled the same way as any table queries</p>

<p>Of course, those fake models would just be used to read datas.</p>

<p>I'm wondering:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if someone already tried that ?</p></li>
<li><p>if it's a good idea ?</p></li>
<li><p>if I should look into something like memcached instead...</p></li>

This would be very easy if we could use the IIS integrated security. However we can't do this. We don't have a trust to the domain controller of the customer. ANd we want to website to be available to the general internet. Only when people are connecting from within the clients network they should automatically login.</p>

<p>What we have is a list of domain accounts and a way to query the DC via LDAP in asp.net code. When anonymous access is allowed in IIS, IIS never challenges the browser for credentials. And thus our application never gets the users credentials.</p>

<p>Is there a way to force the browser into sending the credentials (and thus be able to use single sign-on) with IIS accepting anonymous request.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> </p>

<p>I tried sending 401: unauthorized, www-authenticate: NTLM headers by myself. What happens next (as Fiddler tells me) is that IIS takes complete control and handles the complete chain of request. As I understand from various sources is that IIS takes the username, sends a challenge back to the browser. The browser returns with encrypted reponse and IIS connects to the domain controller to authenticate the user with this response.</p>

<p>However in my scenario IIS is in a different windows domain than the clients and have no way to authenticate the users. For that reason building a seperate site with windows authenticaion enabaled isn't going to work either.</p>

<li>Creating a domain trust between our hosting domain and the clients domain (our IT department isn'tto happy with this)</li>

I just asked a question about how the erlang compiler implements pattern matching, and I got some great responses, one of which is the compiled bytecode (obtained with a parameter passed to the c() directive):</p>

<pre><code>{function, match, 1, 2}.
  {label,1}.
    {func_info,{atom,match},{atom,match},1}.
  {label,2}.
    {test,is_tuple,{f,3},[{x,0}]}.
    {test,test_arity,{f,3},[{x,0},2]}.
    {get_tuple_element,{x,0},0,{x,1}}.
    {test,is_eq_exact,{f,3},[{x,1},{atom,a}]}.
    return.
  {label,3}.
    {badmatch,{x,0}}
</code></pre>

<p>its all just plain erlang tuples. I was expecting some cryptic binary thingy, guess not. so Im asking this on impulse here (I could look at the compiler source but asking questions always ends up better with extra insight), how is this output translated in the binary level?</p>

<p>say <code>{test,is_tuple,{f,3},[{x,0}]}</code> for example. Im assuming this is one instruction, called 'test'... anyway, so this output would essentially be the AST of the bytecode level language, from which the binary encoding is just a 1-1 translation?
This is all so exciting, I had no idea that I can this easily see what the erlang compiler break things into. </p>

<p>I would like to write unit tests to test the entire family of functions for this property, without having to write an individual test case for each function (particularly since more functions might be added later). </p>

<p>One way to do this would be to iterate over a list of these functions:</p>

<pre><code>import unittest
import numpy

from somewhere import the_functions
from somewhere.else import TheClass

class Test_the_functions(unittest.TestCase):
  def setUp(self):
    self.matrix1 = numpy.ones((5,10))
    self.matrix2 = numpy.identity(5)

  def testOutputShape(unittest.TestCase):
     """"""Output of functions be of a certain shape""""""
     for function in all_functions:
       output = function(self.matrix1, self.matrix2)
       fail_message = ""%s produces output of the wrong shape"" % str(function)
       self.assertEqual(self.matrix1.shape, output.shape, fail_message)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
  unittest.main()
</code></pre>

<p>I got the idea for this from <a href=""http://www.diveintopython.net/unit_testing/romantest.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dive Into Python</a>. There, it's not a list of functions being tested but a list of known input-output pairs. The problem with this approach is that if any element of the list fails the test, the later elements don't get tested.</p>

<p>I looked at subclassing unittest.TestCase and somehow providing the specific function to test as an argument, but as far as I can tell that prevents us from using unittest.main() because there would be no way to pass the argument to the testcase.</p>

<p>I also looked at dynamically attaching ""testSomething"" functions to the testcase, by using setattr with a lamdba, but the testcase did not recognize them.</p>

<pre><code>// abstract base class

class Polygon {
    protected:
        int width;
        int height;
    public:

class Rectangle: public Polygon {
    public:
        int area(void) { return width * height; }
};

class Triangle: public Polygon {
    public:
        int area(void) { return width * height / 2; }
};

int main () {
    Rectangle rect;
    Triangle trgl;
    Polygon * ppoly1 = &amp;rect;
    Polygon * ppoly2 = &amp;trgl;

    cout &lt;&lt; ppoly2-&gt;area() &lt;&lt; endl; // outputs 10
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>My question is how does the compiler know that ppoly1 is a Rectangle and that ppoly2 is a Triangle, so that it can call the correct area() function? It could find that out by looking at the ""Polygon * ppoly1 = &rect;"" line and knowing that rect is a Rectangle, but that wouldn't work in all cases, would it? What if you did something like this?</p>

<pre><code>cout &lt;&lt; ((Polygon *)0x12345678)-&gt;area() &lt;&lt; endl;
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming that you're allowed to access that random area of memory.</p>

<p>I would test this out but I can't on the computer I'm on at the moment.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have looked at many posts to see if this was posted before, and it was not.  Here's the short version:</p>

<p>I am going through the sample FB Connect tutorial (v1) and cannot make it work in IE8 on Win7.  It works as expected on FF3 on Win7.</p>

<p>Long Version:</p>

<p>I was suprised that things weren't working since I had pretty much copy and pasted over the content.  I skipped over the bit with the alert() javascript call, so I put that in to see if the parser was even getting to that.  I put the following code in:</p>

<pre><code>[my raw html]
Or use, &lt;fb:login-button length=""long"" onlogin=""alert('yo!!!');""&gt;&lt;/fb:login-button&gt;
[/my raw html]
</code></pre>

<p>The Alert is not popping on IE8.  It works on FF.</p>

<p>When I change back to calling the update_user_box(), my HTML looks like:</p>

<pre><code>Or use, &lt;fb:login-button length=""long"" onlogin=""update_user_box();""&gt;&lt;/fb:login-button&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    function update_user_box() {
        var user_box = document.getElementById(""user"");
        user_box.innerHTML =
            ""&lt;span&gt;""
            + ""&lt;fb:profile-pic uid='loggedinuser' facebook-logo='true'&gt;&lt;/fb:profile_pic&gt;""
            + ""Welcome, &lt;fb:name uid='loggedinuser' useyou='false'&gt;&lt;/fb:name&gt;.""
            + ""You are signed in.""
            + ""&lt;/span&gt;""

        FB.XFBML.Host.parseDomTree();
    }

    FB.init(""23e24c73feed7ca0f6afd876575842de"", ""../../Connect/xd_receiver.htm"", { ""ifUserConnected"": update_user_box });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this works in FF3 just fine.  My picture shows up and everything.  It actually makes me more upset that it worked in FF3 than a complete no work situation.</p>

<p>Here is the witnessed behavior in IE8:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When I click on the FBConnect button. the javascript window pops up and loads the right logon page</p></li>
<li><p>Focus changes back to the main window (the one with my app)</p></li>
<li><p>The main IE8 window (the one where I clicked the connect button) now shows a facebook logon page.</p></li>
<li><p>When I input my credentials into the FB javascript window, the page loads a blank doc

<p>5, If I close that window and type my credentials into the app window, the page reloads with the FBConnect button.</p>

<p>As I said, I am getting the expected behavior in FF3, but not IE8.  I even tried IE8's compatability mode, but that didn't work either.  Anyone have any clues as to what is happening?</p>

<p>At various points in time, I need to clear out my array and refresh the data from my data source.  However, just calling <code>removeAllObjects</code> on my <code>NSMutableArray</code> object does not trigger the KVO updates, so the list on screen remains unchanged.</p>

<p><code>NSArrayController</code> has <strong>no</strong> <code>removeAllObjects</code> method available, which seems really weird. (It does have <code>addObject</code>, which I use to add the objects, ensuring the KVO is triggered and the UI is updated.)</p>

<p>The cleanest way I've managed to cause this happen correctly is:</p>

<pre><code>[self willChangeValueForKey:@""myArray""];
[myArray removeAllObjects];
[self didChangeValueForKey:@""myArray""];
</code></pre>

<p>...so I'm kind of having to do the KVO notification manually myself (this is in my test app class, that contains the <code>myArray</code> property, which is <code>NSMutableArray</code>, as mentioned.)</p>

<p>This seems wrong - is there a better way? From my googling it seems a few people are confused by the lack of <code>removeAllObjects</code> in <code>NSArrayController</code>, but haven't seen any better solutions.</p>

<p>I have seen this solution:</p>

<pre><code>[self removeObjectsAtArrangedObjectIndexes:
  [NSIndexSet indexSetWithIndexesInRange:
    NSMakeRange(0, [[self arrangedObjects] count])]];

<p>but this looks even more unpleasant to me. At least my solution is at least marginally self-documenting.</p>

<p>Did Apple not notice that sometimes people might want to empty a list control being managed via an <code>NSArrayController</code> object?  This seems kind of obvious, so I think I must be missing something...</p>

<p>Aside: of course, if I add new items to the array (via <code>NSArrayController</code>), then this triggers a KVO update with the <code>NSArrayController/NSTableView</code>, but:</p>

<p>We want, however, expose some of the services to some business partners. The set of services they have access to depend on the contract. Kind of a standard architecture.</p>

<p>I think we can implement a <em>service gateway</em> which authenticates the requests and relays them to the correct internal service endpoint (this resembles simple ESB), so we can centralize the authentication/authorization code and expose one single endpoint to the world. I looked at some available ESB toolkits, but they seem way too complex for this purpose. We do not need to integrate a lot of different services, but just to expose some of them to the Internet.</p>

If I use a joined JPA query it generates just one SQL query but doesn't find rows will null relationship.</p>

<p>Example, consider this simple schema. A person lives at an address and is employed by a company. Both address and employer are optional and can thus be null.</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public  class Person {
    public name;

    @ManyToOne
    @Column(nullable=true)
    public Address address

    @ManyToOne
    @Column(nullable=true)
    public Company employer
}

@Entity
public  class Address {
    address attributes ...
}

@Entity
public  class Company {
    company attributes ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Not shown above is that each JPA entity has some sort of ID (key):</p>

<pre><code>@Id
public Integer id;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I'm seeing is that a single JPA query on Person results in multiple SQL queries on the database. For example, the following JPA query:</p>

<pre><code>select p from Person p where ...
</code></pre>

<p>results in the SQL query:</p>

<pre><code>select ... from Person where ...
</code></pre>

<p>and also the following pair of SQL queries for <strong>each</strong> retrieved person:</p>

<pre><code>select ... from Address a where a.id=xxx
select ... from Company c where c.id=yyy
</code></pre>

<p>This has a huge impact on performance. If the query result set is 1000 people, then it generates 1+1000+1000=2001 SQL queries.</p>

<p>So I tried optimizing the JPA query by forcing it to join:</p>

<pre><code>select p from Person p join p.address a join p.employer e where ...
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>select p, a, e from Person p join p.address a join p.employer e where ...
</code></pre>

<p>This results in one single SQL query with a bunch of joins. The problem is if address or employer is null, then the joined query won't find it.</p>

<p>So I'm left with either using the join-less query which is slow, or the fast joined query that doesn't retrieve rows will null relationships. I must be missing something here. Surely there's a way for fast and complete querying.</p>

<p>Ok, the background:</p>

<p>I need to create a Huffman tree of codes from the information provided by the FFC4, DHT (Define Huffman Table) header in a jpg file. The DHT header defines the Huffman table in this way:</p>

<p>1) A series of 16 bytes. Each byte defines how many symbols have a Huffman code of n amount of bits where n is the position of the byte in the series. (did that make any sense?!!) For example the raw data in hex is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>00 01 05 01 01 01 ... 00</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this means that:</p>

<pre><code>Num of bits:    1   2   3   4   5   6   7 ...  16  
Num of codes:   00  01  05  01  01  01  01 ... 00
</code></pre>

<p>2) After the list of 16 bytes come the actual symbols themselves. For example: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3) Combining the two parts we see that their are:<br>
 00 codes with 1 bit.<br>
 01 codes with 2 bits: so take the first symbol from the list: 00<br>
 05 codes with 3 bits: so take the next 5 symbols from the list: 01 02 03 04 05<br>
 .. and so on</p>

<p>4) Finally we have to work out the actual Huffman codes from the information above. If you're a mathematical genius, you may have spotted already that these codes can be worked out by simply incrementing a binary number with the appropriate number of bits for every new code at a certain bit length. When the bit length increases, simply increment the binary number and then double it and carry on. It becomes obvious to everyone else when you've drawn out a number of these binary trees by hand...</p>

<p>5) So this is the code I used to work out the Huffman codes and store them in an array: (first I read the data at 1) and put it in an array: dhtBitnum)</p>

<pre><code>            int binaryCode = 0;
            count = 0;
            StringBuffer codeString = new StringBuffer();               

            //populate array with code strings
            for (int numBits=1; numBits&lt;=16; numBits++) {

                //dhtBitnum contains the number of codes that have a certain number of bits
                for (int i=1; i&lt;=dhtBitnum[(numBits-1)]; i++) {

                    //turn the binary number into a string
                    codeString.append(Integer.toBinaryString(binaryCode)); 
                    //prepend 0s until the code string is the right length
                    for(int n=codeString.length(); n&lt;numBits; n++) {
                        codeString.insert(0, ""0"");
                    }
                    //put the created Huffman code in an array
                    dhtCodes[count]=codeString.toString();
                    binaryCode++;
                    count ++;
                    codeString.delete(0, codeString.length());
                }
                binaryCode = binaryCode &lt;&lt; 1;

            }
</code></pre>

<p>Once I have generated the Huffman codes and stored them in order, I can just add the symbols that they refer to in order as they come along in 2). This may not be terribly elegant but it seems to work at least and creates the correct tables.</p>

<p>6) If anyone is still following this, you deserve a medal.</p>

<p>7) Now the problem is I'd like to store this information in a binary tree so that I can efficiently decode the jpg image data later on, rather than searching through arrays everytime. Unfortunately I can't figure out a nice clean and efficient way to do this directly from the information provided in the jpg headers as above.<br>
The only way I can think of is by working out the Huffman codes as above first, then implementing some method that creates nodes as needed and saves the symbols in the appropriate place, using the codes as an address of sorts. However this seems such a round about way that is also duplicating the information I need, I'm sure there must be a much better and simpler method.</p>

<p>8) So if anyone understood my ramblings, I'd be very grateful for some suggestions. I realise this is a very specific problem, but if nothing else the info above might prove helpful to someone. I am still very new at this so excuse my ignorance, easy to understand code is especially welcome!</p>

<p>Where I am having trouble is tryin to access <code>UrlHelper</code> from <strong>within</strong> my HtmlHelper's definition. The problem is that the way you normally access <code>HtmlHelper</code> (via <code>Html.MethodName(...)</code>  ) is via a property on the View. This isn't available to me obviously from with my own extension class.</p>

<p>This is the actual MVC source code for <code>ViewMasterPage</code> (as of Beta) - which defines <code>Html</code> and <code>Url</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public class ViewMasterPage : MasterPage
    {

</code></pre>

<p>Each line may or may not be part of a big block of quoted text. Example:</p>

<pre><code>This line is not quoted.
This part of the line is not quoted “but this is.”
This one is not quoted either.
“This entire line is quoted”
Not quoted.
“This line is quoted
and so is this one

This is not quoted “but this is

</code></pre>

<p>I need a RegEx replacement that will un-wrap the hard-wrapped quoted lines, i.e., replace ""\r\n"" with a space, but only between the curly quotes.</p>

<p>Here's how it should look after replacement:</p>

<pre><code>This line is not quoted.
This part of the line is not quoted “but this is.”
This one is not quoted either.
“This entire line is quoted”
Not quoted.
“This line is quoted and so is this one and so is this one.”
This is not quoted “but this is and so is this.”

<p><strong>Constraints</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ideally need a single Regex replace call</li>
<li>Using .NET RegEx library</li>
<li>The quotes are <em>always</em> start/end curly quotes, not plain ol' double-ticks (""), which should make this a little easier.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important Constraint</strong></p>

<p>This is not direct .NET code, I'm populating a table of ""searchfor/replacewith"" strings that are then called via RegEx.Replace. I don't have the ability to add custom code like Match Evaluators, looping through captured groups, etc.</p>

<p>Current answer so far, something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>r.Replace(""(?&lt;=“)\r\n(?=”)"", "" "")
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, I'm not even close yet.</p>

<p>The same logic could be applied to, say, color-coding of block comments in programming code--anything inside the block comment is not treated the same way as the stuff outside the comments. (Code is a little trickier since start/end block comment delimiters can also legitimately exist within a literal string, an issue I don't have to deal with here.)</p>

Why is that? I would think that the attribute instance would basically be a singleton-per-MemberInfo, with 1 instance bound to the Type, PropertyInfo, etc...</p>

<p>Here is my test code:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

namespace AttribTest
{
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class)]
class MyAttribAttribute : Attribute
{
    public string Value { get; set; }

    public MyAttribAttribute()
        : base()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""Created MyAttrib instance"");
    }
}

[MyAttrib(Value = ""SetOnClass"")]
class MyClass
{
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""Getting attributes for MyClass."");
        object[] a = typeof(MyClass).GetCustomAttributes(false);
        ((MyAttribAttribute)a[0]).Value = ""a1"";

        Console.WriteLine(""Getting attributes for MyClass."");
        a = typeof(MyClass).GetCustomAttributes(false);
        Console.WriteLine(((MyAttribAttribute)a[0]).Value);

        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now if <em>I</em> were to implement attributes, I would expect the output to be:</p>

<pre><code>Created MyAttrib instance
Getting attributes for MyClass.
Getting attributes for MyClass.
a1
</code></pre>

<p>Where the ""class loader"" (sorry, I have more of a Java background, not 100% sure how .net loads its types) would compile MyClass, and create an instance of MyAttribAttribute, and store them together somewhere. (probably the Perm Gen in the heap if this were Java) The 2 calls to GetCustomAttributes() would then just return the same earlier created instance.</p>

<p>But the actual output is:</p>

<pre><code>Getting attributes for MyClass.
Created MyAttrib instance
Getting attributes for MyClass.
Created MyAttrib instance
SetOnClass
</code></pre>

<p>So... why? It seems like creating a new instance of all these objects for every call is a bit excessive, and not good for performance/memory management.  Is there any way to always get the same instance over and over?</p>

<p>Anyone have any ideas why it was designed this way?</p>

<p>The reason I care at all is because I made a custom attribute that internally holds some validation information, so in the Attribute I basically have a ""private bool Validated"" that I set to true. The validation stuff takes a while, so I don't want to run it every time. Now the problem is that since it creates a new instance of the attribute each time I get the attributes, Validated is always ""false"".</p>

<p>I want to be able to process arbitrarily large numbers in C#.<br>
I can live with just integers.  </p>

<p>Are there established algorithms for this kind of thing?<br>
Or is there a good 3rd-party library?  </p>

<p>I might consider changing language if there really is no good way to do it in C#.  </p>

<p>Thanks for any help / suggestions.  </p>

<p>We're having a lot of problems getting utl_smtp to talk to any smtp server on our network. We've even tried installing free smtp server on the oracle box but it will not spot the mail server running on port 25. The error code is ORA-29278.</p>

<p>So two questions really.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Does anyone have any experience setting up email using Oracle's utl_smtp utility and have any suggestions as to where we might be going wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Does anyone know if it is possible to get utl_smtp to dump text emails to a directory much as you can do if you're using system.net.mail's specifiedpickupdirectory config setting. This would be by far the preferable option.</p></li>

<p>I'm populating the combo as follows:</p>

<pre><code>          Dim VATCombo As New DataGridViewComboBoxColumn
            With VATCombo
                .HeaderText = ""VAT Rate""
                .Name = .HeaderText
                Dim VATCol As New JCVATRateCollection

                VATCol.LoadAll(EntitySpaces.Interfaces.esSqlAccessType.StoredProcedure)
                For Each Rate As JCVATRate In VATCol
                    .Items.Add(Rate.str.VATRate)
                Next
                .Sorted = True

                VATCol = Nothing

                .ToolTipText = ""Select VAT Rate""
                .AutoSizeMode = DataGridViewAutoSizeColumnMode.DisplayedCells
                .CellTemplate.Style.BackColor = Color.Honeydew
                .DisplayIndex = 8
                .AutoSizeMode = DataGridViewAutoSizeColumnMode.Fill

            End With
            .Columns.Add(VATCombo)
            VATCombo = Nothing
</code></pre>

<p>I want to be able to set a default value for each new line added to the grid, I also want to be able to change the values in the combo based on other business logic. I realise I can just set the cell value directly but I want to avoid hard-coding the values into the system and rely on the database to populate.</p>

<p>I'm sure it must be straight-forward but it's eluding me.....</p>

Here's my problem - this code is shared between a web application and a non-web application, In the web application, I'm using System.Web.HttpContext to determine the user's preferred language, but now my Windows app won't even compile, because it says HttpContext isn't defined (I've already tried adding an imports for the full namespace - no dice).</p>

<p>I would love to use some kind of try/catch block if I can't otherwise work around it, but that doesn't change that the windows app won't compile with a reference to HttpContext in it. Without moving this chunk of code into a new file and including it only in the web application (I don't own that app, so I'd rather not deal with those implications), is there another choice I have to deal with this?</p>

<p>If it doesn't make sense, please let me know and I'll do my best to clarify.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> I just added a reference to System.Web, which allowed my application to compile. I also wrapped the HttpContext reference in an ""If HttpContext.Current isnot Nothing Then...End If"" block, which causes it to skip over the code if it's not running as  a web application, which is exactly what I was looking for.</p>

"21328579","1","","","2014-01-24 06:18:20","","2","5761","<p>I am attempting to learn how to program a little. I am making this script for my Raspberry Pi, but the concept doesn't have to be specifically for it. I want to have a button press that will execute one of two commands:</p>

<p>If held for one second, then run command A
If held for five seconds, then run command B
It is okay for command A to run multiple times while waiting for B to register.</p>

<p>Here is my script, and afterwards I will explain its purpose:</p>

<pre><code>import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import uinput
inport time
import os

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(17, GPIO.IN)

def main():
     events = (
          uinput.KEY_ESC,
          )

     device = uinput.Device(events)

     device.emit(uinput.KEY_ESC, 1) #Press
     device.emit(uinput.KEY_ESC, 0) #Release
</code></pre>

<p>Then, here are the two things that I want to have added:</p>

<pre><code>while 1:

     if time.sleep(1)
     if GPIO.input(17)==True:
          main()
          break

while 1:

     if time.sleep(10)
     if GPIO.input(17)==True:
          os.system(""sudo reboot"")
          break
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially, this script will cause the button to have two purposes. Pressing it for one second will emulate a keystroke of the key ESC. Pressing it for ten seconds will cause it to reboot the system. How can I have the two happen at the same time? Learning Python is pretty challenging for me, but I've had no programming experience at all until now.</p>

<p>I have the following content goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support a book I'm writing</li>
<li>Move my blog to my own site (from blogger.com)</li>
<li>Publish my articles (more persistent content than a blog)</li>
<li>Host a forum with light use</li>
<li>Embed slide sharing and screencasts</li>
</ul>

<p>I have the following technology goals for implementing my site:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learn more Python and Django</li>
<li>Leverage a CMS solution such as Pinax or Django-CMS</li>
<li>Utilize a CSS framework, such as Blueprint or YUI</li>
<li>I develop on a Mac OS X platform</li>
<li>I'm comfortable developing in a CLI, but I'd like to practice Eclipse or NetBeans</li>
<li>I'd like to employ testing during development</li>
<li>Please, no Microsoft languages or tools</li>
</ul>

<p>Any suggestions for technology choices that support these goals?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  Apologies if the question above was too unclear or general.  What I'm asking for is if folks have had experience doing a similar modest website, what would be recommendations for tools, frameworks, or techniques outside of those I listed?</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there another Python CMS that I should consider besides the two I listed?  E.g. there may be a great Python solution, but it isn't built on top of Django.</li>
<li>Perhaps all current Python CMS packages are too ""alpha,"" and I'd be better off writing my own from scratch?  Although I am up to it, I'd rather leverage an existing package.</li>
<li>Given this kind of project, would you deploy a CMS with built-in (or plug-in) support for blogs, forums, etc. or would you rather design a simpler website and embed the more complex content management using other services, relying on your own website only as a dumb proxy or portal.  E.g. one can re-publish Blogger.com content using the Google Gdata API.  One can embed re-branded Nabble.com archives into any website, which may provide forum/mailinglist functionality more easily than running the forum itself.</li>
<li>Sometimes a CMS package has its own CSS integrated, and using another CSS framework would be redundant or otherwise make no sense.  Yes?  No?</li>
<li>Are there plugins for Django in Eclipse or Netbeans?  I understand there's a pretty nice environment for Rails development in NetBeans, and I've read some people wish longingly for something similar for Django, but I don't know if these wishes have since been realized.</li>
<li>What are some current preferred tools for unit and functional testing a Django application?  Are these integrated with Eclipse or Netbeans?</li>

<li>Many packages (the <a href=""http://www.emacsmirror.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Emacsmirror</a> provides that largest available collection of packages, but there is no explicit support in any package manager yet).</li>
<li>Only packages that have been tested.</li>
<li>Support for more than one package archive (so people can choose between many/tested packages).</li>
<li>Dependency calculated based on required features only.</li>
<li>Dependencies take particular versions into account.</li>
<li>Only use versions that have been released upstream.</li>
<li>Use versions from version control systems if available.</li>
<li>Packages are categorized.</li>
<li>Packages can be uninstalled and updated not only installed.</li>
<li>Support creating fork of upstream version of packages.</li>
<li>Support publishing these forks.</li>
<li>Support choosing a fork.</li>
<li>After installation packages are activated.</li>
<li>Generate autoload files.</li>
<li>Integration with Emacswiki (see wikirel.el).</li>
<li>Users can tag, comment etc. packages and share that information.</li>
<li>Only FSF-assigned/GPL/FOSS software or don't care about license.</li>
<li>Package manager should be integrated be distributed with Emacs.</li>
<li>Support for easily contacting author.</li>
<li>Lots of metadata.</li>
<li>Suggest alternatives before installing a particular package.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>I am hoping for these kinds of answers</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pointers to more implementations, discussions etc.</li>
<li>Lengthy descriptions of a set of features that make up your ideal package manager.</li>
<li>Descriptions of one particular desired/undesired feature. Feel free to elaborate on my ideas from above.</li>
<li>Surprise me.</li>

"711101","1","711534","","2009-04-02 18:50:50","","1","5765","<p>I have an ASP.NET application that implements keep-alive by using a hidden IFRAME with a refresh header (or meta refresh tag in the page).</p>

<p>For many - but not all - instances of Internet Explorer (reproduced so far on IE7 and IE8 beta - but not for everyone!) if you move between two secure pages that both contain this keep-alive IFRAME, you get something like this sequence of events:</p>

<pre>
 0s: load page1.html - includes keepalive.html, schedules a refresh at 15s
 5s: click the page2 link
     load page2.html - includes keepalive.html, schedules a refresh at 20s
15s: refresh of frame on page1 happens; mixed content error box displayed
</pre>

<p>At this point the error ""This page contains both secure and non-secure content"" is displayed in the browser. </p>

<p><em>page1.html:</em></p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Page 1&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This is Page 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""page2.html""&gt;Go to Page 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=""keepalive.html"" width=""500"" height=""200"" /&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Page 2 is the same but says Page 2, and links to Page 1, instead.</p>

<p><em>keepalive.html:</em></p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=""refresh"" content=""15"" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This is the keep alive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In all the browsers I have tested this in I have ensured that the internet zone has permission to do a meta refresh and is set to prompt when displaying mixed content.  I have read all the pages suggesting that you need to have a src="""" tag on your IFRAME or IE will consider it insecure - by design it has to have a src tag, which is that of the keep-alive page.</p>

<p>If you sit on Page 1 forever, the IFRAME refreshes fine.  The error only shows up the first time after you change to Page 2.</p>

<p>I am looking for a way to fix this with minimal change: a better method for keep-alive would be to use a <a href=""http://www.adamtibi.net/post/2008/02/11/session-keep-alive-web-control.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">control &amp; automatically-refreshing images</a>, which I will investigate for future versions.  A possible workaround I have in mind is having contents of the IFRAME be a regular XMLHttpRequest to the server, instead of a meta refresh.  A simpler bugfix would be even better.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> I have marked Grant Wagner's answer as correct because it lead me to the actual problem: the Lenovo Password Manager add-on, CpwmIEBrowserHelper, causes this error.  This neatly explains why some people see this problem and not others - most of the people I asked have ThinkPads.  Disabling the extension makes the refresh problem go away.</p>

<p>As we can't cause everyone who might use the application to fix this problem, we are going to go with a javascript timer and refreshing the window location, updating the keepalive.html page to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=""pragma"" content=""no-cache""&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This is the keep alive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

  setTimeout ('ReloadPage()', 15000 );

  function ReloadPage() {
     window.location = window.location;
  }

&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

So, I am reading a book and going through examples trying to teach myself how to write an iPhone application using Objective-C.  All has been good so far, however, once in a while I run into the generic '<code>objc_exception_throw</code>' message at runtime.  When this happens, the source of this exception is very difficult to find.  After some trial and error I found my answer.  One of the parameters was misspelled.  </p>

<p>As you can see below, I misspelled the 'otherButtonTitles' parameter by leaving out the second 't' in button.  </p>

<p>The reason this took me time to find is that the code built successfully.  Is this normal behavior for the Objective-C compiler?  I am used to having the build fail in the .NET compiler when I make a common syntax error like this.  Is there a compiler setting I can change to make the built fail when I make these mistakes?</p>

<p>In the Core project I have an entity <strong>Customer</strong> defiend. In the XTend project, I have an entity defined that subclasses Customer named <strong>xCustomer</strong> (for lack of a better name at this time...). </p>

<p>The idea here is that we have a Core domain model in our application. A customer can then create a new assembly that contains extensions to our core model. When the extension assembly is present a smart <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">IRepository</a> class will return a subclass of the core class instead.</p>

<li>Second, I need a callback event for jeditable, when its finished showing the edit-component, to recalculate the <a href=""http://kelvinluck.com/assets/jquery/jScrollPane/jScrollPane.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">scrollbar</a></li>

<p>Im not so familiar with Javascript, so i can't extend/correct this two libraries by my own. Has anyone used another js-library for inplace edit with auto growing textareas (no complete editors like TinyMCE, I need a solution for plain text)?</p>

<p>I also found <a href=""http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Growfield"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Growfield</a>, it would work for other browsers, but there's no jeditable integration...</p>

<p>This works perfectly in FF3, however it would only work randomly in IE6/7. </p>

<p>The server confirms that post requests are coming through from IE, yet it would get the post data only occasionally.</p>

<p>Curious, I decided to alert the data variable:</p>

<pre><code>$.post(url, {'test':'test'}, function(data) {alert(data);}, ""text"");
</code></pre>

<p>Surely enough, FF3 would print out the return HTML every time, while IE6/7 would mostly print blanks, with an occasional HTML return. I was not able to find anything on this problem, so what am I doing wrong?</p>

<p><strong>Resolved:</strong> I tracked this to an HTTP redirect I had in my request handling code. So the function handling the POST request would throw a redirect, and IE does not like it. I had a total mental constipation at the time, and I don't really need the redirect.</p>

<p>The weird part, of course, is that this works in FF, and IE would on occasion work as well, with the redirect in place. </p>

Maybe ""covariant"" isn't the word I'm looking for, but this concept is very similar to covariant return types on functions, so I think it's probably correct.  Here's what I want to do and it gives me a compiler error:</p>

class Derived : public Base;

SmartPtr&lt;Derived&gt; d = new Derived;
SmartPtr&lt;Base&gt; b = d; // compiler error

<p>Assume those classes are fully fleshed out... I think you get the idea.  It can't convert a <code>SmartPtr&lt;Derived&gt;</code> into a <code>SmartPtr&lt;Base&gt;</code> for some unclear reason.  I recall that this is normal in C++ and many other languages, though at the moment I can't remember why.</p>

<p>My root question is: what is the best way to perform this assignment operation?  Currently, I'm pulling the pointer out of the <code>SmartPtr</code>, explicitly upcasting it to the base type, then wrapping it in a new <code>SmartPtr</code> of the appropriate type (note that this is not leaking resources because our home-grown <code>SmartPtr</code> class uses intrusive reference counting).  That's long and messy, especially when I then need to wrap the <code>SmartPtr</code> in yet another object...  any shortcuts?</p>

<p>The .NET situation is considerably nicer, with Socket.BeginRead / Socket.EndRead, where the continuation is passed directly to Socket.BeginRead, and that's where you pick back up. A continuation coded as a closure obviously has all the context you need, and more.</p>

<p>The threads appear in pairs, see stacktrace at the bottom.</p>

<p>I have tried using some slightly obscure system properties to turn off timeouts alltogether in JMX but it doesn't make a difference. The key action seems to be the dynamic proxy call. The object that is called through the proxy implements Serializable so that shouldn't be a problem.</p>

<p>We have a large number of xml configuration files that we want merged into one master version at build time. Smaller config files are easier to maintain and one large file loads faster so I imagined this to be a popular build transformation process that I would find lots of good examples of on the net. </p>

<p>I was able to find some good solutions to one part of the problem <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/217591/concatenating-xml-files-with-xslt"">here at StackOverflow</a> but they all rely upon knowing the names of the xml files that need merging up front. This seems like an unnecessary overhead to me. It should be possible to write a build script which can dynamically calculate which input xml files are needed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the only way I could find to achieve this was a bit of a hack. It works like this,</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a random ant task I stole of the internet to write a directory listing into an xml file.</li>
<li>Feed the xml file into an xslt transformation that can then load the other directory listing referenced xml files and concatenate them.</li>
<li>Delete the temporary xml file containing the directory listing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's the ant script</p>

<pre><code>&lt;taskdef name=""xml-dir-list""
  classname=""net.matthaynes.xml.dirlist.AntFileListing""
  classpath=""antlib/xml-dir-listing.0.1.jar;
    antlib/jakarta-regexp-1.5.jar;antlib/log4j-1.2.14.jar""/&gt;

&lt;macrodef name=""build-plugin-xml"" description=""todo""&gt;
    &lt;attribute name=""pluginName""/&gt;

    &lt;xml-dir-list depth=""0"" verbose=""false"" 
      srcDir=""${src.dir}/@{pluginName}/forms/"" includesRegEx=""\.xml$"" 
      destFile=""${src.dir}/@{pluginName}/forms/fileList.xml""/&gt;

    &lt;xslt in=""${src.dir}/forms/fileList.xml""
      out=""${src.dir}/@{pluginName}/@{pluginName}_extn.yuix
      style=""${src.dir}/@{pluginName}/forms/extn.yuix.xsl"" /&gt;

    &lt;delete file=""${src.dir}/@{pluginName}/forms/fileList.xml""/&gt;
&lt;/macrodef&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the stylesheet,</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=""1.0"" 
  xmlns:xsl=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform""&gt;
    &lt;xsl:output method=""xml"" version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" indent=""yes""/&gt;

    &lt;xsl:template match=""/""&gt;
        &lt;Forms applicationId=""YFSSYS00011""&gt;
            &lt;GlobalExtensions&gt;
                &lt;Tasks/&gt;
            &lt;/GlobalExtensions&gt; 
            &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=""directory/file""/&gt;
        &lt;/Forms&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

    &lt;xsl:template match=""file""&gt;
        &lt;xsl:copy-of select=""document(@name)/Forms/Form""/&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Has anyone found a simpler way to achieve this dynamic discovery of what files to merge in XSLT? It's not surprising that XSLT cannot read directories directly, but I was hoping to find a simpler way to pass in a list of file names than through another xml file.</p>

<h2>Deploy assembled artifacts to production box</h2>

<p>Here, we create the <code>.war</code> (or whatever) elsewhere, configure it for production (possibly creating numerous artifacts for numerous boxes) and place the resulting artifacts on the production servers.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>: No dev tools on production boxes, can re-use artifacts from testing directly, staff doing deployment doesn't need knowledge of build process</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>: two processes for creating and deploying artifacts; potentially complex configuration of pre-built artifacts could make process hard to script/automate; have to version binary artifacts </li>
</ul>

<h2>Build the artifacts <strong>on</strong> the production box</h2>

<p>Here, the same process used day-to-day to build and deploy locally on developer boxes is used to deploy to production.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>: One process to maintain; and it's heavily tested/validated by frequent use.  Potentially easier to customize configuration at artifact creation time rather than customize pre-built artifact afterword; no versioning of binary artifacts needed.</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>: Potentially complex development tools needed on all production boxes; deployment staff needs to understand build process; you <strong>aren't</strong> deploying what you tested</li>
</ul>

<p>I've mostly used the second process, admittedly out of necessity (no time/priority for another deployment process).  Personally I don't buy arguments like ""the production box has to be clean of all compilers, etc."", but I <strong>can</strong> see the logic in deploying what you've tested (as opposed to building another artifact).  </p>

<p>However, Java Enterprise applications are so sensitive to configuration, it feels like asking for trouble having two processes for configuring artifacts.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Here's a concrete example:</p>

<p>We use OSCache, and enable the disk cache.  The configuration file must be inside the .war file and it references a file path.  This path is different on every environment.  The build process detects the user's configured location and ensures that the properties file placed in the war is correct for his environment.   </p>

<p>If we were to use the build process for deployment, it would be a matter of creating the right configuration for the production environment (e.g. <code>production.build.properties</code>).</p>

<p>If we were to follow the ""deploy assembled artifacts to the production box"", we would need an additional process to extract the (incorrect) OSCache properties and replace it with one appropriate to the production environment.</p>

<p>All of these questions are valid and there have been some responses but this got me thinking.  Based on the principle that you can write good code in any language and bad code in any language, I thought it worth asking a positive rather than negative question.  Rather than <strong>why you can't</strong>, I wanted to ask <strong>how you can</strong> use PHP for large projects.</p>

<p>So, how do you write a large, complex, scalable, secure and robust PHP application?</p>

<p>EDIT: While I appreciate that the organizational aspects are important, they apply to <strong>any</strong> large project.  What I'm primarily aiming for here is technical guidance and how to deal with common issues of scalability.  Using an opcode cache like APC is an obvious starter.  Cluster-aware sessions would be another.  That's the sort of thing I'm getting at.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;system.web&gt;
  &lt;authentication mode=""Forms""&gt;
    &lt;forms loginUrl=""Default.aspx"" path=""/"" protection=""All"" timeout=""360"" name=""MyAppName"" cookieless=""UseCookies""  /&gt;

      &lt;deny users=""*""/&gt;
    &lt;/authorization&gt;
  &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/location&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Based on what I have read, this should ensure that the only users able to access the Admin directory will be users who have been Authenticated and assigned the Admin role.</p>

<p>User authentication, saving the authentication ticket, and other related issues all work fine. If I remove the  tags from the web.config file, everything works fine. The problem comes when I try to enforce that only users with the Admin role should be able to access the Admin directory.</p>

<p>Based on this <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/311495"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MS KB article</a> along with other webpages giving the same information, I have added the following code to my Global.asax file:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Application_AuthenticateRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e) {
    if (HttpContext.Current.User != null) {
        if (Request.IsAuthenticated == true) {    
            // Debug#1            
            FormsAuthenticationTicket ticket = FormsAuthentication.Decrypt(Context.Request.Cookies[FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName].Value);
            // In this case, ticket.UserData = ""Admin""                
            string[] roles = new string[1] { ticket.UserData }; 
            FormsIdentity id = new FormsIdentity(ticket);
            Context.User = new System.Security.Principal.GenericPrincipal(id, roles);
            // Debug#2
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I try to log in, I am unable to access the Admin folder (get redirected to login page). </p>

<p>Trying to debug the issue, if I step through a request, if I execute Context.User.IsInRole(""Admin"") at the line marked Debug#1 above, it returns a false. If I execute the same statement at line Debug#2, it equals true. So at least as far as Global.asax is concerned, the Role is being assigned properly.</p>

<p>After Global.asax, execution jumps right to the Login page (since the lack of role causes the page load in the admin folder to be rejected). However, when I execute the same statement on the first line of Page_Load of the login, it returns false. So somewhere after Application_AuthenticateRequest in Global.asax and the initial load of the WebForm in the restricted directory, the role information is being lost, causing authentication to fail (note: in Page_Load, the proper Authentication ticket is still assigned to Context.User.Id - only the role is being lost).</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong, and how can I get it to work properly?</p>

<p>For example, running the following code in C#, returns null:</p>

<pre><code>var _db = new MyDBEntities();
var product = (from p in _db.Product
               where p.ProductID == 3

product.Company // == null

<h2>Things I have tried:</h2>

<hr>

<p>Running the following SQL, returns the company record correctly.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Company.*
FROM Product
  LEFT JOIN Company ON (Product.CompanyID = Company.CompanyID)
WHERE Product.ProductID = 3
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The next thing I would do to debug this issue, would be to run the following code:</p>

<pre><code>var _db = new MyDBEntities();
var product = (from p in _db.Product
               where p.ProductID == 3
               select p).First();
var company = (from c in _db.Company
               where c.CompanyID == product.CompanyID
               select c).First();
</code></pre>

<p>However, that does not compile because the field Product.CompanyID is hidden by the ORM generator and I don't see an option in the designer to add it.</p>

<hr>

<p>The next best thing to run I guess is the following, and it did return a company:</p>

<pre><code>var _db = new MyDBEntities();
var company = (from c in _db.Company
               where c.CompanyID == 2
               select c).First();

<p>Just to be clear, Product with ID 3 corresponds to Company with ID 2.</p>

<p>I tried creating the exact same relationship using <em>LINQ to SQL Classes</em> and it works fine.</p>

<p>I have also looked at chapter 8 of <a href=""http://www.pragprog.com/titles/svn/pragmatic-version-control-using-subversion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pragmatic Version Control using Subversion</a>.</p>

<p>They all have good advice, but I'm having a hard time relating it to my needs.</p>

<p>Basically, I want to organize the code for our web server.  We have a $WEBROOT/htdocs and $WEBROOT/cgi-bin.  Under our htdocs dir we have $WEBROOT/htdocs/js and $WEBROOT/htdocs/css for java script and style sheets.</p>

<p>Our ""projects"" are not really projects, but small bits of code - maybe a Perl script, java script file, and a style sheet.  We have maybe a hundred or so of these small ""projects"" that are all pretty much independent of each other, but all live under the same $WEBROOT on the same webserver.</p>

<p>Our code is not in subversion yet, but I want it to be - I am just having trouble organizing it efficiently.  We can have multiple svn repositories if needed, but if each repository was only 3-10 elements, that seems like a waste to me.</p>

<p>What I thought could work is something like this:  If I write a script to count the running processes on the webserver (for the sake of an example).  Let's say I have a perl script, a js file, and a css file.  I could name the ""project"" webserver_processes, and check it into the repository as:</p>

<pre><code>/svnrepo/webserver_processes/trunk
</code></pre>

<p>Under trunk, I could have:</p>

<pre><code>htdocs/html/webserver_processes
htdocs/js/webserver_processes
htdocs/css/webserver_processes
cgi-bin/webserver_processes
</code></pre>

<p>I don't have any static html docs in this ""project"" but if i did, they would go in the ""html"" directory.</p>

<p>The benefit I see in this structure is that I can checkout one ""project"" at a time without really affecting anything else on the web server.  The disadvantage (and maybe it isn't really a disadvantage) is deploying.  I would have to deploy 1 project at a time from the repository.  I don't see how it would be possible to create a working copy with my structure of $WEBROOT/htdocs and $WEBROOT/cgi-bin using this method.</p>

<p><strong>Another option:</strong></p>

<p>I could create a svn repository like this:</p>

<pre><code>/svnrepo/webcode/trunk
</code></pre>

<p>Under trunk would be all of the code on my web server, in these two directories:</p>

<pre><code>htdocs
cgi-bin
</code></pre>

<p>The huge disadvantage would be, for a small code change to 1 element, I would have to checkout every piece of code in my web environment.  The benefit (somewhat) would be I could do an ""svn update"" on our web server to pick up any changes committed to the repository.</p>

<p>Maybe I am just making this more complex than it should be, but does anyone have any advice on how I could efficiently organize my code in subversion?</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance!</p>

"58431","1","","","2008-09-12 07:10:21","","13","5788","<p>I have wondered for some time, what a nice, clean solution for joining an array of strings might look like.
Example: I have [""Alpha"", ""Beta"", ""Gamma""] and want to join the strings into one, separated by commas – ""Alpha, Beta, Gamma"".</p>

<p>Now I know that most programming languages offer some kind of join method for this. I just wonder how these might be implemented.
When I took introductory courses, I often tried to go it alone, but never found a satisfactory algorithm. Everything seemed rather messy, the problem being that you can not just loop through the array, concatenating the strings, as you would add one too many commas (either before or after the last string).
I don’t want to check conditions in the loop. I don’t really want to add the first or the last string before/after the loop (I guess this is maybe the best way?).</p>

<p>Can someone show me an elegant solution? Or tell me exactly why there can’t be anything more elegant?</p>

<p>In Linux, I can <code>mprotect</code> to change those values, but I can't read them back.</p>

<p>Furthermore, is there any way to know when those permissions change (e.g. when someone uses <code>mmap</code> on a file behind my back) other than doing something terribly invasive and using <code>ptrace</code> on all threads in the process and intercepting any attempt to make a <code>syscall</code> that could affect the memory map?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm using this inside of a JIT that has very little information about the code it is executing to get an approximation of what is constant. Yes, I realize I could have a constant map of mutable data, like the vsyscall page used by Linux. I <em>can</em> safely fall back on an assumption that anything that isn't included in the initial parse is mutable and dangerous, but I'm not entirely happy with that option.</p>

<p>Right now what I do is I read <code>/proc/self/maps</code> and build a structure I can binary search through for a given address's protection. Any time I need to know something about a page that isn't in my structure I reread /proc/self/maps assuming it has been added in the meantime or I'd be about to segfault anyways.</p>

<p>It just seems that parsing text to get at this information and not knowing when it changes is awfully crufty. (<code>/dev/inotify</code> doesn't work on pretty much anything in <code>/proc</code>)</p>

        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

<p>Then I'm using jQuery 1.3.1 and jQuery UI 1.6rc6:</p>

<pre><code>$j('.draggable-item').each(function()
{
    $j(this).draggable({
       addClasses: false,
       revert: true, 
       zIndex: 2000,
       cursor: 'move'
    });
});

$j('.droppable-cell').each(function()
{
    $j(this).droppable({
        addClasses: false,
        activeClass: 'droppable-cell-candrop',

<p>My problem is that in FX, Safari, Chrome, etc (i.e. all the decent browsers) this works fine. </p>

<p>IE really struggles though.  With a 5x5 table IE's delay on the start of a drag is noticeable.  On a 10x10 table with maybe 100 items the start of the drag hangs the browser. </p>

<p>I want to be able to support up to round 20x15 cells and maybe up to 500 items - is this just impossible? It doesn't seem like it should be.</p>

Basically, I want to do something like this:</p>

I'm aiming to build a framework to allow for the integration of different traffic simulation models. This integration is based upon the sharing of link connectivities, link costs, and vehicles between simulations.</p>

<p>To make a distributed simulation, I plan to have a 'coordinator' (star topology). All participating simulations simply register with it, and talk only to the coordinator. The coordinator then coordinates the execution of various tasks between each simulation.</p>

<p>A quick example of a distribution problem, is when one simulation is 'in charge' of certain objects, like a road. And another is 'in charge' of other roads. However, these roads are interconnected (and hence, we need synchronisation between these simulations, and need to be able to exchange data / invoke methods remotely).</p>

<p>I've had a look at RMI and am thinking it may be suited for this task. (To abstract out having to create an over-wire signalling discipline).</p>

<p>Is this sane? The issue here, is that simulation participants need to centralize <em>some</em> of their data storage in the 'coordinator' to ensure explicit synchronisation between simulations. Furthermore, some simulations may require components or methods from other simulations. (Hence the idea of using RMI).</p>

<p>My basic approach is to have the 'coordinator' run a giant RMI registry. And every simulation simply looks up everything in the registry, ensuring that the correct objects are used at each step.</p>

<p>Anyone have any tips for heading down this path?</p>

<p>I have a Crystal Report which displays customers' fuel transactions.  There are occasions when a duplicate transaction will be imported erroneously.  If/when this error is discovered, the admin will reverse transaction, thus leaving the two original duplicates and a ""negative"" transaction for the reversal.  Example:</p>

<pre><code>Date;     Qty;     Value;     Reversal

1/14/08     5       20         N
1/14/08     5       20         N
1/14/08    -5      -20         Y
1/20/08     8       56         N
1/22/08     9       62         N
1/22/08     9       62         N
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally, the customer will only see SINGLE transactions (or a duplicate transaction which has not been reversed yet).  If the transaction has been reversed, we only want them to see the original unique record.  Example (based on data above):</p>

<pre><code>Date;     Qty;     Value;

1/14/08     5       20

<p>When a XMLSchemaValidationException is encountered the finally block will invoke close() and the original XMLReader is being positioned on the EndElement of the subtree and hence the finally block in processA will lead to processing of the next node A.</p>

<p>However when a XMlException is encountered invoking the close method is not positioning the original reader on the EndElement node of the subtree and an InvalidOperationException is being throw.</p>

<p>I tried to use methods like skip, ReadToXYZ() methods but these are invariably leading to XMLExcpetion of InvalidOperationException when invoked on any node that triggered an exception.</p>

<p>The following is a excerpt from MSDN regarding the ReadSubTree method.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the new XmlReader has been
  closed, the original XmlReader will be
  positioned on the EndElement node of
  the sub-tree. Thus, if you called the
  ReadSubtree method on the start tag of
  the book element, after the sub-tree
  has been read and the new XmlReader
  has been closed, the original
  XmlReader is positioned on the end tag
  of the book element.</p>

Now as the referer URL carries the url that the person was trying to visit (dont ask why, Ive no idea) it causes me to have a duplicate of every value.</p>

<p>So visiting this...</p>

<p><strong>home.aspx?test=test&amp;test2=test2</strong></p>

<p>becomes </p>

<p><strong>home.aspx?test=test&amp;test2=test2&amp;referrerurl=home.aspx?test=test&amp;test2=test2</strong></p>

<p>Now, URL Encoding the referrer would sort the issue but i've more chance of being molested by a gorilla; so the question stands.
How do I dedupe the output from .QueryString ?</p>

<p>Currently I'm using this ...</p>

<pre><code>private string queryClean(string entity)
{
    try
    {
        if(Request.QueryString[""referrerUrl""] != null){
        string[] Split = entity.Split(new Char[] { ',' });
        string tmpValue = Convert.ToString(Split[0]);

        return tmpValue;
        }else{ return entity; }
    }
    catch (Exception cleanError) 
    { 
        errors.Text += ""-clean-"" + cleanError + ""-endclean-"";
        return entity;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>(ignore the try/catch we have app level error catching, but I'm still playing with it).</p>

<p>I'm using C# .net 2</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<hr>

<p>[Additional Info]</p>

<p>The reffererURL will always be on the end of the string so it could be possible to delete all of the query string after this point?</p>

<p>I've tried using </p>

<pre><code>string test = Convert.ToString(Request.QueryString);
string[] tRSplit = Regex.Split(test, ""&amp;referrerUrl"");
Response.Write(tRSplit[0]);
</code></pre>

<p>and...</p>

<pre><code>System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;string&gt; testb = new System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;string&gt;(Convert.ToString(Request.QueryString).Split('&amp;'));
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; testb.Count; i++)
            {

                Response.Write(i +"": ""+ testb[i].ToString()+""&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"");
            }
</code></pre>

<p>Both still produce the duplicates </p>

<pre><code>Guid g = new Guid();
object o1 = g;
byte[] b = (byte[]) Convert.ChangeType(o1, typeof(byte[])); // throws exception
</code></pre>

<p>I am aware that Guid provides a ToByteArray() method, but I would like to have that called when Guid is converted to byte[]. The reason behind this is that the conversion also takes place in library code (AseDataAdapter) which I can not modify. So is it possible to define a conversion rule between two types without modifying the sourcecode of either of the two classes?</p>

<p>I was experimenting with TypeConverter, but doesn't seem to work either:</p>

<pre><code>Guid g = new Guid();
TypeConverter tc = TypeDescriptor.GetConverter(typeof(Guid));
byte[] b2 = (byte[])tc.ConvertTo(g, typeof(byte[])); // throws exception
</code></pre>

<p>The variable tc gets set to System.ComponentModel.GuidConverter which doesn't support conversions to byte[]. Can I have two TypeConverters for the same class? Even if I could, wouldn't I need to prepend an attribute to the source code of the class to assign a TypeConverter?</p>

<p>The best idea I could come up with is to fork each update, so if it dies, the overall update just continues.
From what I gathered, it seems PHP threading isn't something to rely on, especially on a windows platform (which I unfortunately have to work on).</p>

<pre><code>play = (isMode) ? new MainMode(numberRanges, numberOfGuesses) : 
                  new TestMode(numberRanges, numberOfGuesses, randNo());
</code></pre>

<p>My Game (play) would either create a MainMode object or a TestMode object depending on a boolean value (isMode). As you can see I am adding an extra value into my TestMode object (randNo()). This value is used within TestMode to allow the user to input their own ""Random Number"", whereas within the MainMode constructor this was randomly generated. In this program both MainMode and TestMode are sub-classes of the abstract class Game.</p>

<p>Now I want to replace this line with a Factory Pattern, although I am unsure as my TestMode constructor requires an extra object and I am unsure where I would need to pass this value. If I were going to create a Factory it'd need to be in a new class, probably named GameFactory or ModeFactory or something along those lines.</p>

<p>How would I go about this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The problem here is that the code above is in my GUI, where the values for numberRanges, numberOfGuesses and the randNo() method are. I want to create a Factory class but I am unable to pass these values through because randNo() activates itself. Here is my randNo() method.</p>

<pre><code>private int randNo() {
    boolean isValidNumber = true;
    int testRandomNum = 0;
    while(isValidNumber) {
        try {
            testRandomNum = Integer.parseInt(JOptionPane.showInputDialog(""Enter Random Number""));
            isValidNumber = false;
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, ""Sorry, but the number you entered was invalid"");
        }
    }

    return testRandomNum;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that whenever I pass randNo() it displays the JOptionPane. As I've said already the GUI and Logic is separate. The GUI is in a GUI package whilst the rest of the code is in the logic package.</p>

insert into Test (column1, column2) values (2,3)

<p>One possible application would be 'previous/next' links in a photo album or blog web application, where the underlying data is in a SQL table.</p>

<p>Sample data:</p>

<p>What query (or queries) would give 3 and 19 when supplied 8 as the parameter? (or the rows 3,8,19). Note that there are not always three rows to be returned - at the ends of the sequence one would be missing.</p>

<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, if there is a separate unique key to order the elements by, what is the query to return the set 'surrounding' a date? The order expected is by date then key.</p>

<p>Sample data:</p>

<pre><code>(key:date) 1:1,2:3,3:8,4:8,5:19,10:19,11:67,15:45,16:8
</code></pre>

<p>What query for '8' returns the set:</p>

<pre><code>2:3,3:8,4:8,16:8,5:19
</code></pre>

<p>or what query generates the table:</p>

<pre><code>key date prev-key next-key
1   1    null     2
2   3    1        3
3   8    2        4
4   8    3        16
5   19   16       10
10  19   5        11
11  67   10       15
15  45   11       null
16  8    4        5
</code></pre>

<p>The table order is not important - just the next-key and prev-key fields.</p>

<hr>

<p>Both TheSoftwareJedi and Cade Roux have solutions that work for the data sets I posted last night. For the second question, both seem to fail for this dataset:</p>

<pre><code>(key:date) 1:1,2:3,3:8,4:8,5:19,10:19,11:67,15:45,16:8
</code></pre>

<p>The order expected is by date then key, so one expected result might be: </p>

<pre><code>2:3,3:8,4:8,16:8,5:19
</code></pre>

<p>and another:</p>

<pre><code>key date prev-key next-key
1   1    null     2
2   3    1        3
3   8    2        4
4   8    3        16
5   19   16       10
10  19   5        11
11  67   10       15
15  45   11       null
16  8    4        5

<ul>
<li>The Enum State is represented as a string even though I tried to force it to use INT</li>
<li>The phone number length does not match the mapping.</li>

This is what <a href=""http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/langref/mx/managers/CursorManager.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>mx.managers.CursorManager</code></a> does, for example. The reason why I find this approach unacceptable is that Flash Player isn't nearly fast enough at updating the cursor graphic, leading to some very <strong>visible lag</strong> in the cursor movement, which I find to be a pretty fundamental usability problem and annoyance, making the whole app seem slower than it really is.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I've noticed that the <strong>CSS <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/CSS/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_cursor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>cursor</code></a> property</strong> implementation in browsers works like it should -- i.e. there's no visible lag in the cursor movement when using it to implement a custom mouse cursor.</p>

<p>So my question is: <em>is there any way to use the CSS <code>cursor</code> property (or any other method that doesn't involve lagging, slow cursor movement) to change the cursor on top of a Flash rectangle?</em></p>

    }

</code></pre>

<p>Then FxCop will insist that <code>AContainer</code> is also made <code>IDisposable</code>.</p>

<p>Which is fine, but I can't see how I can safely call <code>m_someObject.Dispose()</code> from <code>AContainer.Dispose()</code>, as another class may still have a reference to the <code>m_someObject</code> instance.</p>

<p>What is the best way to avoid this scenario?</p>

<p>(Assume that other code relies on <code>AContainer.SomeObject</code> always having a non-null value, so simply moving the creation of the instance outside of the <code>AContainer</code> is not an option)  </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I'll expand with some example as I think some commenters are missing the issue. If I just implement a <code>Dispose()</code> method on <code>AContainer</code> which calls m_someObject.Dispose() then I am left with these situations:</p>

<pre><code>// Example One
AContainer container1 = new AContainer();
SomeDisposableObject obj1 = container1.SomeObject;
container1.Dispose();
obj1.DoSomething(); // BAD because obj1 has been disposed by container1.

// Example Two
AContainer container2 = new AContainer();
SomeObject obj2 = new SomeObject();
container2.SomeObject = obj2; // BAD because the previous value of SomeObject not disposed.
container2.Dispose();
obj2.DoSomething(); // BAD because obj2 has been disposed by container2, which doesn't really ""own"" it anyway.

<p>There doesn't seem to be a good way to edit longer text columns in the SQL Server Managers for SQL Server 2000 or 2005.  While SQL Server Manager is really not for editing data in your db, what other tool does Microsoft provide that would normally allow you to do this?  Every other field is pretty easy to edit, except long text fields.  In Access, you could hit shift-f2 and it would pop up a nice dialog to edit your text in.</p>

int HashVector(const vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; v) {

<p>The algorithm I'm interested in would hash integer vectors, but something for float vectors would also be cool.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification</strong></p>

<p>The hash is intended for use in a hash table for fast key/value lookups.  There is no security concern here.</p>

<p>The desired answer is something like a set of constants that provably work particularly well for a hash like this - analogous to a multiplier and modulo which works better than others as a pseudorandom number generator.</p>

<p>For example, some choices of constants for a linear congruential pseudorandom generator are known to give optimal cycle lengths and have easy-to-compute modulos.  Maybe someone has done research to show that a certain set of multiplicative constants, along with a modulo constant, in a vector hash can reduce the chance of collisions amongst nearby integer vectors.</p>

<pre><code>public class Test {
    static void f(Object a, boolean b) {}
    static void f(Object a, Object b) {}

    static void m(int a, boolean b) { f(a,b); }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When compiled, it causes the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Test.java:5: reference to f is ambiguous, both method
    f(java.lang.Object,boolean) in Test and method
    f(java.lang.Object,java.lang.Object) in Test match

static void m(int a, boolean b) { f(a, b); }
                                  ^
</code></pre>

<p>The fix to this error is trivial: just use explicit auto-boxing:</p>

<pre><code>static void m(int a, boolean b) { f((Object)a, b); }
</code></pre>

<p>Which correctly calls the first overload as expected.</p>

<p>So why did the overload resolution fail? Why didn't the compiler auto-box the first argument, and accept the second argument normally? Why did I have to request auto-boxing explicitly?</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM oracleServer..owner.table1 WHERE id = @id;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I have is that the table on the lined server or Oracle is very big with 4M rows of data. The above query took about 2minutes to get data back. This code is just a simplied piece. Actually my SP has some other queries to update, insert data from the lined server to my SQL server. The SP took hours or 10+ hours to run with large Oracle db. Therefore T-SQL with lined server is not good for me.</p>

<p>Recently I found OPENQUERY and EXEC (...) AT linedServer. OPENQUERY() is very fast. It took about 0 time to get the same result. However, it does not support variable query or expressions. The query has to be a literal constant string.</p>

<p>EXEC() is in the same way to pass-through query to Oracle. It is fast as well. For example:</p>

<pre><code>EXEC ('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM owner.table1 WHERE id = ' + CAST(@id AS VARCHAR))
  AT oracleServer
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I have is how to pass the result COUNT(*) back. I tried to google examples in web and msdn. All I can find are SQL or ExpressSQL linedServer examples like:</p>

<pre><code>EXEC ('SELECT ? = COUNT(*) FROM ...', @myCount OUTPUT) AT expressSQL
</code></pre>

<p>This query does not work for Oracle. It seems in Oracle, you can set value as output in this way:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) INTO myCount ...
</code></pre>

<p>I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>EXEC ('SELECT COUNT(*) INTO ? FROM ...', @myCount OUTPUT) AT oracleServer
EXEC ('SELECT COUNT(*) INTO : FROM ...', @myCount OUTPUT) AT oracleServer
EXEC ('SELECT : = COUNT(*) FROM ...', @myCount OUTPUT) AT oracleServer
</code></pre>

<p>None of those working. I got error message saying query not executable on Oracle server. </p>

<p>I could write a .Net SQL Server project to do the job. Before that, I just wonder if there is anyway way to pass value out as oupput parameter so that I put the better performance T-SQL codes in my SP?</p>

<p>I'm Still looking for a monospace Unicode font so it renders completely but with extra spaces it works great.</p>

<p>In order to see math characters UTF-8 has to be the encoding and a font that will display those characters.</p>

<p>I added the following to my vim configuration files.</p>

<p>created custom file: mathdoc.vim in syntax/</p>

<pre><code>"" set the encoding to be utf-8, requires gVim or a terminal capable of
"" unicode see ':help Unicode' for details
set encoding=utf-8
"" requires a font that has characters for the higher uniocode symbols

<p>I added this to filetype to set this for my own custom extension .txtmt</p>

<p>I have modified the example so the 202 isn't right, don't worry about that. On to the problem. The Content-Length matches the number of bytes on the file, however unless I manually increase the Content-Length it does not send all of the file, a few bytes get truncated. The number of bytes truncated is not the same for files of different sizes. I used the -r option on the script and I can see what it is sending and it is sending all of the file, but Google Appengine self.request.body shows that not everything is received. I think the solution is to get the right number for Content-Length and apparently it isn't as simple as number of bytes on the file or the perl script is mangling it somehow.</p>

<p>Update:
Thanks to Erickson for the right answer. I used printf to append characters to the end of the file and it always truncated exactly the number of lines in the file. I suppose I could figure out what is being added by iterating through every character on the server side but not worth it. This wasn't even answered over on the google groups set up for app engine!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can I build a dropdown-menu that uses AJAX (no submit-button) to call the show action of a certain controller?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following things are given:</p>

<p><strong>Model-Association</strong> is <em>Categories HABTM Projects</em>, therefore the dropdown-menu consists of all category names.</p>

<p>The <strong>view partial</strong> where the dropdown-menu should be implemented. Below the dropdown menu is a list of projects that should change according to the choice made in the dropdown menu:</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;!-- placeholder for AJAX dropdown menu --&gt;

   &lt;!-- list of projects related to categories chosen by the select tag --&gt;
   &lt;ul class=""projects""&gt;
     &lt;% @projects.each do |_project| %&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;
         &lt;%= link_to(_project.name, _project) %&gt;
       &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;% end %&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>Categories controller</strong> with the show-action that should be called:</p>

<pre><code>class CategoriesController &lt; ApplicationController
  def show
    # params[:id] should be the choice the user made in the dropdown menu
    @category = Category.find(params[:id])
    @projects = @category.projects.find(:all)

    respond_to do |format|
      format.html # show.html.erb
      format.js   # needed for ajax response?
    end
  end

  def index
    @projects = Category.find(params[:id]).projects.find(:all)
    @category = @project.categories.first

    respond_to do |format|
      format.html # index.html.erb
    end
  end 
end
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>route</strong> to call the show-action in the Categories controller:</p>

<pre><code>category GET    /categories/:id    {:controller=&gt;""categories"", :action=&gt;""show""}
</code></pre>

<p>How would you implement this? Any help is very apreciated!</p>

var option;
var newOption;
targetDropDownList.options.length = 0;

for (var i = 0; i &lt; allOptions.length; i++) {
    option = allOptions[i];
    if (option.key == key) {
        newOption = new Option(option.text, option.value,selectedValue);
        targetDropDownList.options.add(newOption);

<p>This does that: the code within all() asks if all the names in the list ('expvar') of columns in 'samples' are also names in 'grids'.

<p>No else needed, it'll just carry on. The problem is that the '= FALSE' is redundant because all() is a logically evaluable statement... is there a ""carry on"" function, e.g.</p>

<p>The gTLD servers say the name server is ns1.service-provider-here.net and when we lookup the name at that server, it gives an authoritative answer but leaks a different NS name in the authority section (ns1.different-trade-name.net).</p>

<p>There are thousands of domains configured in this way. It doesn't seem to cause any problems, but it seems so wrong.</p>

<p>Does this actually matter? Is there ever going to be a situation where resolvers/clients will do an extra lookup or even fail to resolve the name because of this?</p>

But there are other times when I think concurrent modifications are happening because iterating through the collection appears to be missing items, but no exceptions are thrown.  I know that the docs for <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code> says you can't rely on it, but how would I go about making sure I'm not concurrently modifying a List?  And is wrapping every access to the collection in a synchronized block the only way to prevent it?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Yes, I know about <code>Collections.synchronizedCollection</code>, but it doesn't guard against somebody modifying the collection while you're iterating through it.  I think at least some of my problem is happening when somebody adds something to a collection while I'm iterating through it.</p>

We would like to make it possible to import custom initial settings as part of the installation.  The use case for this is if a company has 100 machines they want to install the software on, and they should all have a reference to the intranet web service in question, this should not need to be set up manually on all the machines.</p>

<p>We are currently using a VS2008 setup project to generate the install package.</p>

<p>Our idea so far has been to enable the installer to make a custom initial .config file with the information (from a template), and then put that in place instead of the default one that the setup project installs.</p>

<p>However, I can't see a way to do this other than these few:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hardcode the executable name into a custom installer action (deriving from System.Configuration.Install.Installer), in order to use the ConfigurationManager class to determine the .config file path.  This would require manual changes to the installer if the executable name changes.</li>
<li>Roll our own configuration classes or file/folder hierarchy to store the settings.  This would basically bar us from the advantages of the isolation mechanism (which is also the obstacle here) that .NET provides, if I understand correctly.</li>
</ol>

<p>Does anyone know of any alternatives, or of ways to make the above two palatable?</p>

class Foo&lt;T&gt; : IFoo
{
    // foo stuff

class Bar&lt;T&gt; : IFoo
{
    // bar stuff

}

<p>I have a Foo and would like a Bar.  Bar has a copy constructor taking a parameter of IFoo.
I created an extension method to implement the clone:</p>

<pre><code>public static Bar&lt;T&gt; Clone&lt;T&gt;(this IFoo foo) 
{
    return new Bar&lt;T&gt;(foo);
}

<p>Calling the method requires the type:</p>

<pre><code>someFoo.Clone&lt;T&gt; ...
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to omit declaring the type when calling the method by modifying the extension method, or any other way, to allow the the instance to just be passed in without caring about its underlying type?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
Here is how this is being used to better illustrate the situation.</p>

<p>In a method I iterate a collection and return an enumeration of IFoo.  In the method I look at an attribute of the source collection and determine the type of the Foo.</p>

<pre><code>IFoo foo = null;

string type = element.Attribute(""Type"").Value;
switch (type)
{
    case ""int"":
        foo = new Foo&lt;int&gt;();

    case ""string"":
        foo = new Foo&lt;string&gt;();
        break;

    // etc
}
// other stuff

yield return foo;
</code></pre>

<p>The calling method has a List.  Later I select individual items from this list for use, at which point I would like a Bar instead of a Foo.  When selecting from the list the instances are of type IFoo, as in they only see the extension methods for ""this IFoo foo"".  I do not want to cast the IFoo to a Foo, that would require re-declaring the type of T.  I would just like to have Foo tell Bar what it is.  Is this possible?</p>

<p>I want to accomplish a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have events done in the browser (eg, drag and drop) trigger an AJAX notification that can raise a control event, which causes code on the page using the control to do whatever it needs to do (eg, change a value in a database). </li>
<li>Have partial updates (NOT using an updatepanel) that can do things like populate an auto-complete dropdown underneath a textbox. </li>
<li>Implement a single user control that is generic enough to be reused on several pages</li>
<li>Avoid having to implement logic on the page itself that passes events back to the control, because that is repetitive and hard to maintain </li>
</ul>

<p>I'm using jQuery for most of the client side stuff, but for the actual AJAX calls I don't really care if it's jQuery or the ASP AJAX libraries. </p>

<p>Effectively what would be perfect is PageMethods on the user control, that would be easily callable from client-side script. Unfortunately, as far as I'm aware, pagemethods do not work on user controls.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'll use an autocomplete control as an example: </p>

<p>I should be able to put the autocomplete control on the page, and then in the page code, have eg:</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub HandleLookup(ByVal input As String, ByRef list As List(Of String) Handles MyControl.LookupEntries
  list = New List(Of String)
  ' Query database for list of items.. 
  For Each item as String in FullItemList
    If item.StartsWith(input) then list.Add(item)
  Next
  Return list
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>And do nothing else .. the rest of the code should be in the usercontrol. </p>

<hr>

<p>Note, the controls I'm trying to make are much more specific than eg, autocomplete. They do not exist in any 3rd party libraries and I really need to be able to make them myself.</p>

The .bat file calls up another .exe and the .bat file has a CMD DOS window that outputs critical error info to that DOS box from the .exe. If the .exe does not start correctly, I am able to check the results in our SQL DB. I need to close the current .bat file and re-launch it.
This seems fairly simple, I can get the ProcessID using the WMI call. I can terminate the process with a Terminate() command. This works for any .exe I use for testing: notepad, calc, iexplorer, etc. When I run the VBScript to kill the .bat file, it says it terminates the PID (which it does, since I cannot see the PID anymore), however, the DOS box is still open and the .exe called from the .bat file is still running. If I click on the ""X"" on the DOS box or right-click on the title bar and select ""Close"", the DOS box and the .exe are both killed. How do I get this script to work correctly. The server is running Windows Server 2003 (some are x32 and others are x64). Any ideas? Here is a version of my code, there have been several revs:</p>

<p>When I select buttons B or C, the AsyncPostBack triggers fine and the dropdown is populated. BUT, subsequently selecting A from either B or C does not trigger the event.</p>

<p>I suspect that because A was checked when the form loaded, the browser is not seeing any ""change"" to raise the event. </p>

<p>So what can be done to enable the default A button recognise it is being changed from B or C in order to raise the postback?</p>

<p>I have tried both setting the checked state of button A in code on inital loading of the page only (ie IsPostBack is False) and alternatively setting the checked attribute of the radiobutton in the html, with the same results. If I don't default the radio button the functionality works as expected, except I don't have the radio button and dropdown list defaulted when the page first loads.</p>

Specifically, I have a list of objects, each indexed by a key (possibly multiple per key). This implies a multimap. The problem with this, however, is that it means a possibly worse-than-linear lookup to find the location of an object. I'd rather avoid duplication of data, so having each object maintain it's own coordinate and have to move itself in the map would be bad (not to mention that moving your own object may indirectly call your destructor whilst in a member function!). I would rather some container that maintains an index both by object pointer and coordinate, and that the objects themselves guarantee stable references/pointers. Then each object could store an iterator to the index (including the coordinate), sufficiently abstracted, and know where it is. Boost.MultiIndex seems like the best idea, but it's very scary and I don't wany my actual objects to need to be const.</p>

<p>What would you recommend?</p>

<p>EDIT: Boost Bimap seems nice, but does it provide stable indexing? That is, if I change the coordinate, references to other elements must remain valid. The reason I want to use pointers for indexing is because objects have otherwise no intrinsic ordering, and a pointer can remain constant while the object changes (allowing its use in a Boost MultiIndex, which, IIRC, does provide stable indexing).</p>

<p>We have a reporting services server where we move and denormalize data from our transaction system for reporting purposes. In order to allow our users to login with the same user name and password from the transactional system we have set up custom forms authentication and after much trial and error it is finally working. In addition we have the authorization accessing our transactional system so that any changes in user authority is immediately reflected in Reporting Services. </p>

<p>Our problem now is that we would like to add some additional features such as locking down parameters depending on user authority/groups in our transactional system. We have found a way to do it but it's inefficient, basically we have stored procedures that will query our transactional system to check for access. The problem is that these queries will often be run for every report request even though the answer is unlikely to change. It would be nice to have access to session level data that can be set once during log in and then accessed from the reports.</p>

<p>From the info I gathered so far, when sending the http request I need to add a header field with a key of ""Range"" and the value ""bytes=startoff-endoff"". Then the server returns a http response with the data between those offsets.</p>

<p>So roughly what I have in mind is to split the file to the number of allowed connections per file and send a http request per splitted part with the appropriate ""Range"". So if I have a 4mb file and 4 allowed connections, I'd split the file to 4 and have 4 http requests going, each with the appropriate ""Range"" field. Implementing the resume feature would involve remembering which offsets are already downloaded and simply not request those.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this the right way to do this?</li>
<li>What if the web server doesn't support resuming? (my guess is it will ignore the ""Range"" and just send the entire file)</li>
<li>When sending the http requests, should I specify in the range the entire splitted size? Or maybe ask smaller pieces, say 1024k per request?</li>
<li>When reading the data, should I write it immediately to the file or do some kind of buffering? I guess it could be wasteful to write small chunks.</li>
<li>Should I use a memory mapped file? If I remember correctly, it's recommended for frequent reads rather than writes (I could be wrong). Is it memory wise? What if I have several downloads simultaneously?  </li>
<li>If I'm not using a memory mapped file, should I open the file per allowed connection? Or when needing to write to the file simply seek? (if I did use a memory mapped file this would be really easy, since I could simply have several pointers).</li>

<p>What I want to do is create an enumerated constants that store the IDs as so that at the worst, only 1 file has to be updated if the DB is ever changed instead of trying to go through thousands upon thousands of lines of code to replace any ID in the system.</p>

<p>This will work on a single system, but in my company's service oriented environment, enumerations don't serialize with their values, just their names.</p>

<p>What is the best way to share IDs across a web service? I'd like to use either enumerations (the ideal situation) or constants in some way, but I can't seem to get this to work. I could make a web method that returns the IDs, but sending a web request for every ID and then serializing the response and deserializing on the client machine just sounds like a bad idea.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong><br>
I wasn't entirely clear about what I was asking, so I'll elaborate.</p>

<p>I want to have a group of constants. The enum would only be used because it groups constants together appropriately. I'm mainly interested in see if there is a way to share constants across a web service. I need the values the enum represent, not the enum itself. The enum is never sent between the service and the client except as an integer. Internally everything is stored as an ID, not an enum.</p>

<p>Having a separate shared library doesn't sound like the ideal solution since I'm almost at the completion point for this project and I'd only be storing 1 enum/class in the library. It seems like a bit of a waste to make for just one class.</p>

<p>It is possible to have multiple data storage layers that implement access to the same object - for example, a main ""database"" data storage source that implements most objects, and another ""ldap"" source that implements a User object. In this scenario, User can optionally come from an LDAP source, perhaps with slightly different functionality (eg, not possible to save/update the User object), but otherwise it is used by the application the same way. Another data storage type might be a web service, or an external database.</p>

<p>There are two main ways we are looking at implementing this, and me and a co-worker disagree on a fundamental level which is correct. I'd like some advice on which one is the best to use. I'll try to keep my descriptions of each as neutral as possible, as I'm looking for some objective view points here. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Business objects are base classes, and data storage objects inherit business objects. Client code deals with data storage objects.</p>

<p>In this case, common business rules are inherited by each data storage object, and it is the data storage objects that are directly used by the client code. </p>

<p>This has the implication that client code determines which data storage method to use for a given object, because it has to explicitly declare an instance to that type of object. Client code needs to explicitly know connection information for each data storage type it is using.</p>

<p>If a data storage layer implements different functionality for a given object, client code explicitly knows about it at compile time because the object looks different. If the data storage method is changed, client code has to be updated.</p></li>
<li><p>Business objects encapsulate data storage objects.</p>

<p>In this case, business objects are directly used by client application. Client application passes along base connection information to business layer. Decision about which data storage method a given object uses is made by business object code. Connection information would be a chunk of data taken from a config file (client app does not really know/care about details of it), which may be a single connection string for a database, or several pieces connection strings for various data storage types. Additional data storage connection types could also be read from another spot - eg, a configuration table in a database that specifies URLs to various web services. </p>

<p>The benefit here is that if a new data storage method is added to an existing object, a configuration setting can be set at runtime to determine which method to use, and it is completely transparent to the client applications. Client apps do not need to be modified if data storage method for a given object changes. </p></li>
<li><p>Business objects are base classes, data source objects inherit from business objects. Client code deals primarily with base classes.</p>

<p>This is similar to the first method, but client code declares variables of the base business object types, and Load()/Create()/etc static methods on the business objects return the appropriate data source-typed objects. </p>

<p>The architecture of this solution is similar to the first method, but the main difference is the decision about which data storage object to use for a given business object is made by the business layer, not the client code. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know there are already existing ORM libraries that provide some of this functionality, but please discount those for now (there is the possibility that a data storage layer is implemented with one of these ORM libraries) - also note I'm deliberately not telling you what language is being used here, other than that it is strongly typed.</p>

<p>I'm looking for some general advice here on which method is better to use (or feel free to suggest something else), and why. </p>

Now I want to add another application B, which should keep track of the database changes of application A. Application B should do some calculations, when data has changed. There is no direct communication between both applications. Both can only see the database.</p>

<p>The basic problem is: Some data changes in the database. How can I trigger some C# code doing some work upon these changes?</p>

<hr>

<p>To give some stimulus for answers, I mention some approaches, which I am currently considering:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make application B polling for
changes in the tables of interest.
Advantage: Simple approach.
Disadvantage: Lots of traffic,
especially when many tables are
involved.</li>
<li>Introduce triggers, which will fire
on certain events. When they fire
they should write some entry into an
“event table”. Application B only
needs to poll that “event table”.
Advantage: Less traffic.
Disadvantage: Logic is placed into
the database in the form of triggers.
(It’s not a question of the
“evilness” of triggers. It’s a design
question, which makes it a
disadvantage.)</li>
<li>Get rid of the polling approach and
use SqlDependency class to get
notified for changes. Advantage:
(Maybe?) Less traffic than polling
approach. Disadvantage: Not database
independent. (I am aware of
OracleDependency in ODP.NET, but what
about the other databases?)</li>
</ol>

<p>What approach is more favorable? Maybe I have missed some major (dis)advantage in the mentioned approaches? Maybe there are some other approaches I haven’t think of?</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit 1: Database independency is a factor for the ... let's call them ... ""sales people"". I can use SqlDependency or OracleDependency. For DB2 or other databases I can fall back to the polling approach. It's just a question of cost and benefit, which I want to at least to think about so I can discuss it.</p>

I am currently using the IFrame implementation of Thickbox.  The problem is that the URL to show is hardcoded into the ""alt' attribute of the button.  What I really need is for the ""alt"" attribute to pass along the value in the textbox to the popup.</p>

<p>Ideally, I would like to put the textbox value into the Search.aspx url but I can't seem to figure out how to do that.  My current alternative is to use jQuery to set the click function of the Search button to call a web service that will set some values in the ASP.NET session.

<p>In code-behind I'm creating a JavaScript function call and adding it to the onchange event of the <code>DropDownList</code>:</p>

<pre><code>XDocument paymentCards = XDocument.Parse(xdsCardTypes.GetXmlDocument().InnerXml, LoadOptions.None);

List&lt;string&gt; regExes = paymentCards.Descendants(""PaymentCard"")
    .Select(pc =&gt; pc.GetAttribute(""RegEx"").Value).ToList();

string setRegExValidatorScript = string.Format(""setRegExValidator('{0}', '{1}', {2});"",
    ddlCardType.ClientID,
    txtCardNumber_RegularExpressionValidator.ClientID,
    regExes.ToJavaScriptArgumentList());

ddlCardType.AddAttribute(""onchange"", setRegExValidatorScript);
</code></pre>

<p>And in a referenced .js file I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>function setRegExValidator(ddlCardTypeID, regExValidatorID, regExes)
{
    var regEx = regExes[$get(ddlCardTypeID).selectedIndex];

    var val = $get(regExValidatorID);

    // TODO: Set the ValidationExpression!
}
</code></pre>

<p>So my one missing link is the ability to set the <code>ValidationExpression</code> from JavaScript. Yes I could use a postback to achieve this, but that seems unnecessary.</p>

<p>(Suggestions on an alternate approach are also welcomed!)</p>

<p>I don't know too much about sockets other than that basics, so bear with me.  The goal is for a client to look for a server on a local network, and this is the result of some cut/paste/edit code.  </p>

<p>This is the client code:</p>

<pre><code>IPEndPoint ipep = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(""127.0.0.1""), 10294);

    byte[] data = new byte[1024];
    public Form1()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

    }

    private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {

        Socket client = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Dgram, ProtocolType.Udp);
        client.SetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel.IP, SocketOptionName.MulticastTimeToLive, 10);
        string welcome = ""What's your IP?"";
        data = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(welcome);
        client.SendTo(data, data.Length, SocketFlags.None, ipep);
        IPEndPoint server = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Any, 0);
        EndPoint tmpRemote = (EndPoint)server;
        data = new byte[1024];
        int recv = client.ReceiveFrom(data, ref tmpRemote);
        this.IP.Text = ((IPEndPoint)tmpRemote).Address.ToString(); //set textbox
        this.Port.Text = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(data, 0, recv); //set textbox
        client.Close();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This is the server code:</p>

<pre><code>int recv;
        byte[] data = new byte[1024];
        IPEndPoint ipep = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Any, 10294);
        Socket newsock = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork,
                SocketType.Dgram, ProtocolType.Udp);
        newsock.Bind(ipep);
        newsock.SetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel.IP, SocketOptionName.AddMembership, new MulticastOption(IPAddress.Any,IPAddress.Parse(""127.0.0.1"")));

        while (true)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""Waiting for a client..."");
            IPEndPoint sender = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Any, 0);
            EndPoint tmpRemote = (EndPoint)(sender);
            data = new byte[1024];
            recv = newsock.ReceiveFrom(data, ref tmpRemote);

            Console.WriteLine(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(data, 0, recv));
            string welcome = ""7010"";
            data = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(welcome);
            newsock.SendTo(data, data.Length, SocketFlags.None, tmpRemote);
        }
</code></pre>

"272665","1","","","2008-11-07 16:44:20","","2","5891","<p>First of all, some background.</p>

<p>We have an order processing system, where staff enter billing data about orders in an app that stores it in a sql server 2000 database.  This database isn't the real billing system: it's just a holding location so that the records can be run into a mainframe system via a nightly batch process. </p>

<p>This batch process is a canned third party package provided by an outside vendor.  Part of what it's supposed to do is provide a report for any records that were rejected.  The reject report is worked manually.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it turns out the third party software doesn't catch all the errors.  We have separate processes that pull back the data from the mainframe into another table in the database and load the rejected charges into yet another table.  </p>

<p>An audit process then runs to make sure everything that was originally entered by the staff can be accounted for somewhere.  This audit takes the form of an sql query we run, and it looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM [StaffEntry] s with (nolock)
LEFT JOIN [MainFrame] m with (nolock)
    ON m.ItemNumber = s.ItemNumber 
        AND m.Customer=s.Customer 
        AND m.CustomerPO = s.CustomerPO -- purchase order
        AND m.CustPORev = s.CustPORev  -- PO revision number
LEFT JOIN [Rejected] r with (nolock) ON r.OrderID = s.OrderID
WHERE s.EntryDate BETWEEN @StartDate AND @EndDate
    AND r.OrderID IS NULL AND m.MainFrameOrderID IS NULL
</code></pre>

<p>That's heavily modified, of course, but I believe the important parts are represented.  The problem is that this query is starting to take too long to run, and I'm trying to figure out how to speed it up.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure the problem is the JOIN from the <code>StaffEntry</code> table to the <code>MainFrame</code> table.  Since both hold data for every order since the beginning of time (2003 in this system), they tend to be a little large.  The <code>OrderID</code> and <code>EntryDate</code> values used in the <code>StaffEntry</code> table are not preserved when imported to the mainframe, which is why that join is a little more complicated.  And finally, since I'm looking for records in the <code>MainFrame</code> table that don't exist, after doing the JOIN we have that ugly <code>IS NULL</code> in the where clause.</p>

<p>The <code>StaffEntry</code> table is indexed by EntryDate (clustered) and separately on Customer/PO/rev.  <code>MainFrame</code> is indexed by customer and the mainframe charge number (clustered, this is needed for other systems) and separately by customer/PO/Rev.  <code>Rejected</code> is not indexed at all, but it's small and testing shows it's not the problem.  </p>

<p>So, I'm wondering if there is another (hopefully faster) way I can express that relationship?</p>

<p>However, when working on my first serious project with Rails, I've gotten hung up on how to properly implement some very basic web site features that most tutorials I've seen lack.</p>

<p>For instance: Navigation menus. Lots of tutorials on how to make a static one, but what about dynamic? If I want to make a navigation bar that's different across pages, how would I go about doing that?</p>

<p>I think that the best way to learn things like this is by seeing example code. Are there any good open sourced sites in RoR? Any example code that I can check out?</p>

<p>I guess my question really results to using MVC. The basic idea is really basic, and I understand that. But it seems that most applications have each part completely separate from each other... what if I want to, say, combine data from two models to display on the same page? To take the example I posed, if I have a NavModel and a PageModel, can my PageController access both models? I guess I'd assumed that a PageController can only access a PageModel, and none other. All examples I've seen seem to operate this way...is that a faulty assumption?</p>

<p>Or am I totally missing the point, and is that 'doing it wrong?' </p>

<p>Today I wrote a little module that deals with in memory buffers and provides access to the data via a file-style interface (e.g. you can read bytes, write bytes, seek around etc.).</p>

<p>As the data-type for current read position and size I used size_t since that seems to be the most natural choice. I get around the warnings and it ought to work in 64-bit as well. </p>

<p>Just in case: My structure looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct
{
  unsigned char * m_Data;
  size_t          m_CurrentReadPosition;
  size_t          m_DataSize;
} MyMemoryFile;
</code></pre>

<p>The signedness of <code>size_t</code> seems not to be defined in practice. A Google code-search proved that.</p>

<p>Now I'm in a dilemma: I want to check additions with <code>size_t</code> for overflows because I have to deal with user supplied data and third party libraries will use my code. However, for the overflow check I have to know the sign-ness. It makes a huge difference in the implementation. </p>

<p>So - how the heck should I write such a code in a platform and compiler independent way? </p>

<p>Can I check the signedness of <code>size_t</code> at run or compile-time? That would solve my problem. Or maybe <code>size_t</code> wasn't the best idea in the first place.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

"20081","1","97091","","2008-08-21 14:29:48","","4","5903","<p>I've written PL/SQL code to denormalize a table into a much-easer-to-query form. The code uses a temporary table to do some of its work, merging some rows from the original table together.</p>

<p>The logic is written as a <a href=""http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/3136"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pipelined table function</a>, following the pattern from the linked article. The table function uses a <code>PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION</code> declaration to permit the temporary table manipulation, and also accepts a cursor input parameter to restrict the denormalization to certain ID values.</p>

<p>I then created a view to query the table function, passing in all possible ID values as a cursor (other uses of the function will be more restrictive).</p>

<p>My question: is this all really necessary? Have I completely missed a much more simple way of accomplishing the same thing?</p>

<p>Every time I touch PL/SQL I get the impression that I'm typing way too much.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I'll add a sketch of the table I'm dealing with to give everyone an idea of the denormalization that I'm talking about. The table stores a history of employee jobs, each with an activation row, and (possibly) a termination row. It's possible for an employee to have multiple simultaneous jobs, as well as the same job over and over again in non-contiguous date ranges. For example:</p>

<pre><code>| EMP_ID | JOB_ID | STATUS | EFF_DATE    | other columns...
|      1 |     10 | A      | 10-JAN-2008 |
|      2 |     11 | A      | 13-JAN-2008 |
|      1 |     12 | A      | 20-JAN-2008 |
|      2 |     11 | T      | 01-FEB-2008 |
|      1 |     10 | T      | 02-FEB-2008 |
|      2 |     11 | A      | 20-FEB-2008 |
</code></pre>

<p>Querying that to figure out who is working when in what job is non-trivial. So, my denormalization function populates the temporary table with just the date ranges for each job, for any <code>EMP_ID</code>s passed in though the cursor. Passing in <code>EMP_ID</code>s 1 and 2 would produce the following:</p>

<pre><code>| EMP_ID | JOB_ID | START_DATE  | END_DATE    |
|      1 |     10 | 10-JAN-2008 | 02-FEB-2008 |
|      2 |     11 | 13-JAN-2008 | 01-FEB-2008 |
|      1 |     12 | 20-JAN-2008 |             |
|      2 |     11 | 20-FEB-2008 |             |
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>END_DATE</code> allows <code>NULL</code>s for jobs that don't have a predetermined termination date.)</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this denormalized form is much, much easier to query, but creating it--so far as I can tell--requires a temporary table to store the intermediate results (e.g., job records for which the activation row has been found, but not the termination...yet). Using the pipelined table function to populate the temporary table and then return its rows is the only way I've figured out how to do it.</p>

<p>Right now, it takes close to 13 seconds to load this DataSet.  I can cut this to 700 milliseconds if I don't read the DataSet's schema and just let ReadXml infer the schema, but then the resulting DataSet doesn't contain any constraints.</p>

<p>I've tried doing this:</p>

<pre><code>Console.WriteLine(""Reading dataset with external schema."");
ds.ReadXmlSchema(xsdPath);
Console.WriteLine(""Reading the schema took {0} milliseconds."", sw.ElapsedMilliseconds);

<p>When I do this, reading the schema takes 27ms, and reading the DataSet takes 12000+ milliseconds.  And that's the time reported <em>before</em> I call EndLoadData on all the DataTables.</p>

<p>This is not an enormous amount of data - it's about 1.5mb, there are no nested relations, and all of the tables contain two or three columns of 6-30 characters.  The only thing I can figure that's different if I read the schema up front is that the schema includes all of the unique constraints.  But BeginLoadData is supposed to turn constraints off (as well as change notification, etc.).  So that shouldn't apply here.  (And yes, I've tried just setting EnforceConstraints to false.)</p>

<p>I've read many reports of people improving the load time of DataSets by reading the schema first instead of having the object infer the schema.  In my case, inferring the schema makes for a process that's about 20 times faster than having the schema provided explicitly.</p>

<p>This is making me a little crazy.  This DataSet's schema is generated off of metainformation, and I'm tempted to write a method that creates it programatically and just deseralizes it with an XmlReader.  But I'd much prefer not to.</p>

<p>So far, I've found occasional references as to what to do with Visual C++ version 6, with one mention that later versions of MFC have additional relevant features.  Searching MSDN gives me instructions on how to convert the apps to Unicode, which we already did.  I found nothing on MSDN on how to make languages multilingual once they're in Unicode, only a few older things using Google, and one book about internationalization using VC++6.

<p>Is there something I should worry about other than setting the locale, converting all strings to resources, and duplicating resources in different languages?</p>

<p>I can find more things about .NET internationalization, but I'm inexperienced in .NET.  What will I find there that's applicable to VC++ and MFC?</p>

<p>Edit:  I just ran into difficulties trying to put Unicode strings into the String Table resource.  (As far as I can tell, Unicode strings need to be entered into the .rc file with a text editor, in L""0x0034"" form.  I haven't found a resource editor way to do that.)  Any tips on that?  Any other resource I can use in VS2008 using VC++ and MFC?</p>

<p>Edit:  Somebody on a Microsoft forum suggested that I open the offending .rc file in Notepad, and save it in Unicode.  Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to fix the dialogs, although the stringtable seems to be working in Japanese.</p>

However, Gap.Com is still coming in wrong.</p>

<p>For Gap.com, HttpWebResponse.CharacterSet is ISO-8859-1, the Encoding i'm getting through GetEncoding is {System.Text.Latin1Encoding}, which says ""ISO-8859-1"" in it's body name, AND the Content-Type META tag in the HTML specified ""charset=ISO-8859-1"".</p>

<p>What languages, libraries and development techniques are you aware of that help alleviate the traditional challenges of creating concurrent applications? I'm obviously thinking of issues like deadlocks and race conditions.

<li>The search bots, etc., are not a concern, this is internal application with dynamic content, which expires very often.</li>

<p>It seems to me that explicitly specifying serialVersionUID for new classes is bad. Consider the two cases of not changing it when layout has it should have been changed and changing it when it should not have. </p>

<p>Not changing when it should have been changed occurs almost only when it is explicit. In this case, it results in some very subtle, hard-to-find bugs. Especially during development, when class layout changes often. But if it has not been explicitly specified, it will change and the deserialization will break loudly, mostly likely solved by purging the repository.</p>

<p>Changing it when should not have would occur almost only when it is implicit. This is the rare case where class layout has changed but we still want to deserialize from the old serialized blobs. This will likely be caught during QA (<em>Strange errors after upgrade from 5.2 to 5.2.1, see attached stack trace</em>) and can be trivially fixed by setting a explicit value. </p>

There is also a 'Sort...' button to set the sort order of the data you are viewing. This can be very handy for viewing some data on the fly. </p>

<p>The problem: I set a sort order for viewing a particular table which is not supported by the indexes on that table.  It seems that SQL Developer does the sort on the fly when you go to view that data.  At first the delay wasn't too bad.  But the table has grown and now it takes forever.  There is no way to stop it except by force quitting SQL Developer, losing anything unsaved.  (If you know another way to stop this sort, let me know!)  So, I should change the viewing sort order to something else, but you can only access the Sort... button when viewing the data. </p>

<p>Is there another way to delete the viewing sort order besides viewing the data?</p>

(Yes, I <em>know</em>, <a href=""http://java.sun.com/products/archive/eol.policy.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">JDK1.4.2 is EOL!</a> ;-) ).</p>

<p>For functions returning a collection (which are not simple <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35007/how-to-expose-a-collection-property"">property collections</a>), I always prefer (in JDK1.4.2) returning an Array instead of a generic List, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>it enforces the returning type (<code>MyObject[]</code> instead of List of Objects, much more <strong><em>type-safe</em></strong> on a static -- as in 'compilation' -- level)</li>
<li>it <em>suggests</em> a 'read-only' character to the returned collection (it is more complicated to add an element to the collection, even though this is not as rigorous as the 'read-only' keyword in c#). This is not the same as saying it is 'immutable' since the references inside the array can still be modified...</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, I do always <em>create</em> this returned array (I do not expose any 'internal' array)</p>

<p>Now, In JDK5 and more, I could use <code>List&lt;MyObject&gt;</code> if I want to.  </p>

<p><strong>What are the good reasons for choosing to return <code>MyObject[]</code> instead of List or <code>Collection&lt;MyObject&gt;</code> when coding in java5 ?</strong></p>

<p>Bonus, if <code>Collection&lt;MyObject&gt;</code> is used, is it possible to:</p>

<ul>
<li>enforce a read-only attribute on the returned collection ? (no <code>add()</code> or <code>remove()</code> possible)</li>
<li>enforce an immutable aspect to the returned collection ? (even the references of that collection can not be modified)</li>
</ul>

I have figured out how to load each of them into different areas of flash, and after taking a memory dump everything looks like it is in the right place.</p>

<p>So when I do a reset it loads the boot, all the boot does at the moment is jump to the application. Debugging the boot, this all appears to work correctly. However the problems arrives after i've made the jump to the application, it just executes one instruction (assembly) and then jumps back to the boot. It should stay in the application indefinitely.</p>

<p>My question is then, where should I 'jump' to in the app? </p>

<p>It seems that there are a few potential spots, such as the interrupt vectors, the reset handler, the main function of the app. Actually I've tried all of those with no success.</p>

<p>Hopefully that makes sense, i'll update the question if not.</p>

<p>thanks for your help!
Richard</p>

<h2>Updates:</h2>

<ul>
<li>I had a play around in the debugger and manually changed the program counter to the main of the application, and well that worked a charm, so it makes me think there is something wrong with my jump, why doesn't the program counter keep going after the jump?</li>
<li>Actually it seems to be the PSR, the 'T' gets reset on the jump, if I set that again after the jump it continues on with the app as I desire</li>
<li>Ok found a solution, seems that you need to have the PC LSB set to 1 when you do a branch or it falls into the 'ARM' mode (32 bit instruction instead of 16 bit instructions like in the 'thumb' mode. Quite an obscure little problem, thanks for letting me share it with you! </li>

b) reset every attribute defined by `h1` when I define `.titledimage h1` ?

<p>I installed embedded JBoss following the JBoss <a href=""http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Tomcat5.5.x?action=e&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;mode=view"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wiki instructions</a>.  And I configured Tomcat using the ""Scanning every WAR by default"" deployment as specified in the <a href=""http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/EmbeddedAndTomcat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">configuration wiki page</a>.</p>

<p>Quoting the config page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JNDI</p>
  
  <p>Embedded JBoss components like connection pooling, EJB, JPA, and transactions make 
  extensive use of JNDI to publish services. Embedded JBoss overrides Tomcat's JNDI 
  implementation by layering itself on top of Tomcat's JNDI instantiation. There are a few > reasons for this:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>To avoid having to declare each and every one of these services within server.xml</li>
  <li>To allow seemeless integration of the java:comp namespace between web apps and 
  EJBs.</li>
  <li>Tomcat's JNDI implementation has a few critical bugs in it that hamper some JBoss 
  components ability to work</li>
  <li>We want to provide the option for you of remoting EJBs and other services that can > be remotely looked up</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone have any thoughts on how I can configure the JBoss naming service which according to the above quote is overriding Tomcat's JNDI implementation so that I can do a lookup on java:comp/env?  </p>

<p>FYI - My environment Tomcat 5.5.9, Seam 2.0.2sp, Embedded JBoss (Beta 3), </p>

<p>Note:  I do have a -ds.xml file for my database connection properly setup and accessible on the class path per the instructions.</p>

<pre><code>search.summary = Your search for {0} found {1} items.

<p>MessageFormat is annoying, because a single quote is a special character, despite being common in English text. You have to type two for a literal single quote:</p>

<pre><code>warning.item = This item''s {0} is not valid.

<p>However, three-quarters of the application's 1000 or so messages do not include a placeholder. This means that we can output them directly, avoiding MessageFormat, and leave the single quotes alone:</p>

<pre><code>help.url = The web page's URL

<p><strong>Question:</strong> should we use MessageFormat for all messages, for consistent syntax, or avoid MessageFormat where we can, so most messages do not need escaping?</p>

<p>There are clearly pros and cons either way.</p>

<p>Note that the API documentation for MessageFormat acknowledges the problem and suggests a non-solution:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rules for using quotes within
  message format patterns unfortunately
  have shown to be somewhat confusing.
  In particular, it isn't always obvious
  to localizers whether single quotes
  need to be doubled or not. Make sure
  to inform localizers about the rules,
  and tell them (for example, by using
  comments in resource bundle source
  files) which strings will be processed

<ul>
<li>What does the kernel do if you stick a shell-script into the shebang line? </li>
<li>How does the Kernel know which interpreter to launch?</li>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>

<p>I recently wanted to write a wrapper around <em>/usr/bin/env</em> because my CGI Environment does not allow me to set the <em>PATH</em> variable, except globally (which of course sucks!).</p>

<p>So I thought, ""OK. Let's set PREPENDPATH and set <em>PATH</em> in a wrapper around env."". The resulting script (here called <em>env.1</em>) looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/env PATH=$PREPENDPATH:$PATH $*
</code></pre>

<p>which looks like it should work. I checked how they both react, after setting PREPENDPATH:</p>

<pre><code>$ which /usr/bin/env python
/usr/bin/env
/usr/bin/python

$ which /usr/bin/env.1 python
/usr/bin/env
/home/pi/prepend/bin/python
</code></pre>

<p>Look absolutely <em>perfect</em>! So far, so good. But look what happens to ""Hello World!"".</p>

<pre><code># Shebang is #!/usr/bin/env python
$ test-env.py
Hello World!

# Shebang is #!/usr/bin/env.1 python
$ test-env.1.py
Warning: unknown mime-type for ""Hello World!"" -- using ""application/*""
Error: no such file ""Hello World!""
</code></pre>

<p>I guess I am missing something pretty fundamental about UNIX.</p>

<p>I'm pretty lost, even after looking at the source code of the original <em>env</em>. It sets the environment and launches the program (or so it seems to me...).</p>

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Posting the message works find, but when the receiving application calls GetMessageText, the string contains ""\0\0\0\0"" (which is NOT what the sending application sent).</p>

<p>I'm calling it like this:</p>

<pre><code>RegisteredMsg.PostUpdateMsg(""test"");
</code></pre>

<p>and receiving it like this:</p>

<pre><code>protected override void WndProc(ref Message msg)
{
    base.WndProc(ref msg);
    if (Convert.ToUInt32(msg.Msg) == RegisteredMsg.RegisteredMessage)
    {
        string text = RegisteredMsg.GetMessageText(msg);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT #0</p>

<p>I also tried it this way, and all of the bytes in the received array are '\0':</p>

<pre><code>//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
public static void PostUpdateMsg(string text)
{
    byte[] array  = StringToByteArray(text);
    IntPtr lpData = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(array.Length);
    Marshal.Copy(array, 0, lpData, array.Length);
    IntPtr lpLength = new IntPtr(text.Length);
    if (!PostMessage(m_handleRef, RegisteredMessage, lpData, lpLength))
    {
        throw new Exception(""Could not post message."");
    }
}

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------public static string GetMessageText(Message msg)
{
    string text   = """";
    int    length = msg.LParam.ToInt32();
    byte[] array  = new byte[length];
    Marshal.Copy(msg.WParam, array, 0, length);
    text          = RegisteredMsg.ByteArrayToString(array);
    return text;
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT #1 </p>

<p>I also called this method from PostUpdateMessage, just to make sure what I was sending was what I thought I was sending:</p>

<pre><code>private static void TestIntPtr(IntPtr ptr, int length)
{
    string text = """";
    byte[] array = new byte[length];
    Marshal.Copy(ptr, array, 0, length);
    text       = ByteArrayToString(array);  // &lt;&lt;------------
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the indicated line is executed, the <code>text</code> variablle is indeed = ""test"", so I'm doing it right on the sending side. It looks like the memory is getting cleared before it gets to the receiving application.</p>

<p>EDIT #2</p>

<p>I also tried making the <code>IntPtr</code> (pointing to the string I want to send) global to its parent class to make sure it would live long enough to be viable at the other end. No joy there, either.</p>

<p>EDIT #3 </p>

<p>I also reverted back to using the <code>StringToHGlobalAuto</code>, and ran the ""is it still okay in the sending app"" test (see Edit #1 above), and that test proved that the way I was building the <code>IntPtr</code> was fine as well.</p>

"160376","1","160538","","2008-10-02 00:30:38","","27","5951","<p>I've noticed that just in the last year or so, many major websites have made the same change to the way their pages are structured. Each has moved their Javascript files from being hosted on the same domain as the page itself (or a subdomain of that), to being hosted on a differently named domain.</p>

<h2>It's not simply parallelization</h2>

<p>Now, there is a well known technique of spreading the components of your page across multiple domains to parallelize downloading.  <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#split"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yahoo recommends it</a> as do many others.  For instance, <strong>www.example.com</strong> is where your HTML is hosted, then you put images on <strong>images.example.com</strong> and javascripts on <strong>scripts.example.com</strong>. This gets around the fact that most browsers limit the number of simultaneous connections per server in order to be good net citizens.</p>

<p>The above is <em>not</em> what I am talking about.</p>

<h2>It's not simply redirection to a content delivery network (or maybe it is--see bottom of question)</h2>

<p>What I am talking about is hosting Javascripts specifically on an entirely different domain. Let me be specific. Just in the last year or so I've noticed that:</p>

<p><strong>youtube.com</strong> has moved its .JS files to <strong>ytimg.com</strong></p>

<p><strong>cnn.com</strong> has moved its .JS files to <strong>cdn.turner.com</strong></p>

<p><strong>weather.com</strong> has moved its .JS files to <strong>j.imwx.com</strong></p>

<p>Now, I know about content delivery networks like <a href=""http://www.akamai.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Akamai</a> who specialize in outsourcing this for large websites.  (The name ""cdn"" in Turner's special domain clues us in to the importance of this concept here).</p>

<p>But note with these examples, each site has its own specifically registered domain for this purpose, and its not the domain of a content delivery network or other infrastructure provider. In fact, if you try to load the home page off most of these script domains, they usually redirect back to the main domain of the company.  And if you reverse lookup the IPs involved, they <em>sometimes</em> appear point to a CDN company's servers, sometimes not.</p>

<h2>Why do I care?</h2>

<p>Having formerly worked at two different security companies, I have been made paranoid of malicious Javascripts.</p>

<p>As a result, I follow the practice of whitelisting sites that I will allow Javascript (and other active content such as Java) to run on. As a result, to make a site like <strong>cnn.com</strong> work properly, I have to manually put <strong>cnn.com</strong> into a list. It's a pain in the behind, but I prefer it over the alternative.</p>

<p>When folks used things like <strong>scripts.cnn.com</strong> to parallelize, that worked fine with appropriate wildcarding.  And when folks used subdomains off the CDN company domains, I could just permit the CDN company's main domain with a wildcard in front as well and kill many birds with one stone (such as *.edgesuite.net and *.akamai.com).</p>

<p>Now I have discovered that (as of 2008) this is not enough. Now I have to poke around in the source code of a page I want to whitelist, and figure out what ""secret"" domain (or domains) that site is using to store their Javascripts on.  In some cases I've found I have to permit three different domains to make a site work.</p>

<h2>Why did all these major sites start doing this?</h2>

<p>EDIT: OK <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/160376/why-move-your-javascript-files-to-a-different-main-domain-that-you-also-own#160451"">as ""onebyone"" pointed out</a>, it does appear to be related to CDN delivery of content.  So let me modify the question slightly based on his research...</p>

<p>Why is <strong>weather.com</strong> using <strong>j.imwx.com</strong> instead of <strong>twc.vo.llnwd.net</strong>?</p>

<p>Why is <strong>youtube.com</strong> using <strong>s.ytimg.com</strong> instead of <strong>static.cache.l.google.com</strong>?</p>

<p>There has to a reasoning behind this.</p>

Does anyone have a theory on the rationale for this limitation? For instance, it would be nice to be able to declare const values of other types, such as IntPtr.</p>

<p>I believe that the concept of <code>const</code> is actually syntactic sugar in C#, and that it just replaces any uses of the name with the literal value. For instance, given the following declaration, any reference to Foo would be replaced with ""foo"" at compile time.</p>

<p>I have troubles coding the hidden layer and adding the activation function $f(s)=tanh(s)$ since the error in the output of the network doesn't seem to decrease. Can someone point out what I am implementing wrong?</p>

As near as I can tell right now they expect each message from us to come in a separate Ethernet frame! They seem to have problems when messages are split across Ethernet frames. </p>

<p>We are on the local network with the device, and there are no routers between us (just a switch).</p>

<p>We are, of course, trying to force them to fix their system, but that may not end up being feasible.</p>

<p>I've already set TCP_NODELAY on my sockets (I connect to them), but that only helps if I don't try to send more than one message at a time. If I have several outgoing messages in a row, those messages tend to end up in one or two Ethernet frames, which causes trouble on the other system.</p>

<p>I can generally avoid the problem by using a timer to avoid sending messages too close together, but that obviously limits our throughput. Further, if I turn the time down too low, I risk network congestion holding up packet transmits and ending up allowing more than one of my messages into the same packet.</p>

<p>Is there any way that I can tell whether the driver has data queued or not? Is there some way I can force the driver to send independent write calls in independent transport layer packets?

This operating system is targeted at the x86 architecture and my target is for modern computers. The estimated number of required RAM is 256Mb or more.</p>

<p>What is a good size to make the stack for each thread run on the system? Should I try to design the system in such a way that the stack can be extended automatically if the maximum length is reached?</p>

<p>I think if I remember correctly that a page in RAM is 4k or 4096 bytes and that just doesn't seem like a lot to me. I can definitely see times, especially when using lots of recursion, that I would want to have more than 1000 integars in RAM at once. Now, the real solution would be to have the program doing this by using <code>malloc</code> and manage its own memory resources, but really I would like to know the user opinion on this.</p>

<p>Is 4k big enough for a stack with modern computer programs? Should the stack be bigger than that? Should the stack be auto-expanding to accommodate any types of sizes? I'm interested in this both from a practical developer's standpoint and a security standpoint.</p>

<p>Is 4k too big for a stack? Considering normal program execution, especially from the point of view of classes in C++, I notice that good source code tends to <code>malloc/new</code> the data it needs when classes are created, to minimize the data being thrown around in a function call.</p>

<p>What I haven't even gotten into is the size of the processor's cache memory. Ideally, I think the stack would reside in the cache to speed things up and I'm not sure if I need to achieve this, or if the processor can handle it for me.

However, I have a one semi-large project whose maintenance / extensibility has reached its end of a life cycle. I was weighing on different PHP frameworks (there were no when the project originated), since it is the way to go for this project, and I came to conclusion the ebst option would be to do it with Zend Framework.</p>

<ul>
<li>Symfony seemed to complicated (I don't like setting up database model as that</li>
<li>CakePHP seemed murky</li>
<li>Igniter I liked at first, but then it seemed to me it is more like Zend with less features and no Zend behind it</li>
<li>Zend I like the system of that I can use only what I like and not being tied into a specific directory structure, and of course there is Zend behind it. Performance is what potentially bothers me</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, after this little rationale behind choosing Zend, there are several things I see as a deal breaker when choosing a framework. </p>

<ul>
<li>I haven't used ORM in the past because I am more than comfortable writing SQL directly, so I still need to be convinced to use ORM</li>
<li>Not too much abstraction going on from the guts</li>
<li>Flexible directory structure</li>
</ul>

<p>
As long as this project is going to be written anew, I just as might write it in Python/Django, since I am quite familiar with Python, but not with Django. So, I would like to know if there is someone that worked with both Zend Framework and Django frameworks and if can outline a few key point differences?
</p>

<p>
I must also say that this project is made as a standard site/admin dual project. That is, it is basically two sites in one. One is for frontend and users, other is for data administration in the backend. I must and will build backend on my own, some scaffolding methods would be cool, but full automatic scaffolding is as good as nothing in this case.
</p>

<p>
 I am still quite not sure how one approaches building basically two applications within a directory structure of, what is supposed to be, one application. Do you just make two separate applications and rely on URL scheme from there on to separate them? www.example.com and all of the /* being one application and www.example.com/admin/* being a second application.
</p>

<p> 
Sorry for the long question(s), but as you can see - everything is pretty much related to one problem - I need to start a project anew, it has already established database+data which I can remodel, but would like to keep that kind of work at minimum.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Ok, thank you everybody - looks like I'll try and implement this stuff with Zend, gives me most flexibility out of the package (I did tests with both), and we'll see how it goes.

That part works fine - I can run the Python web server application from the command line and I can have clients connect to it and get data back. At the moment, to run the web server I have to be logged in to our server as the administrator user and I have to manually start the web server. I want to have the web server automatically start on system start as a service and run in the background.</p>

<p>Using code from <a href=""http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576451/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ActiveState</a>'s site and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32404/can-i-run-a-python-script-as-a-service-in-windows-how"">StackOverflow</a>, I have a pretty good idea of how to go about creating a service, and I think I've got that bit sorted - I can install and start my web server as a Windows service. I can't, however, figure out how to stop the service again. My web server is created from a BaseHTTPServer:</p>

<pre><code>server = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(('', 8081), SIMSAPIServerHandler)
server.serve_forever()
</code></pre>

<p>The serve_forever() call, naturally enough, makes the web server sit in an infinite loop and wait for HTTP connections (or a ctrl-break keypress, not useful for a service). I get the idea from the example code above that your main() function is supposed to sit in an infinite loop and only break out of it when it comes accross a ""stop"" condition. My main calls serve_forever(). I have a SvcStop function:</p>

<pre><code>def SvcStop(self):
    self.ReportServiceStatus(win32service.SERVICE_STOP_PENDING)
    exit(0)
</code></pre>

<p>Which seems to get called when I do ""python myservice stop"" from the command line (I can put a debug line in there that produces output to a file) but doesn't actually exit the whole service - subsequent calls to ""python myservice start"" gives me an error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error starting service: An instance of
  the service is already running.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and subsequent calls to stop gives me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error stopping service: The service
  cannot accept control messages at this
  time. (1061)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think I need either some replacement for serve_forever (serve_until_stop_received, or whatever) or I need some way of modifying SvcStop so it stops the whole service.</p>

It has two means of getting a listing of directory contents. One, <code>FTP.nlst()</code>, will return a list of the contents of a directory given a directory name as an argument.

This is a robust way to list the contents of a directory but does not give any indication whether each item in the list is a file or directory. The other method is <code>FTP.dir()</code>, which gives a string formatted listing of the directory contents of the directory given as an argument (or of the file attributes, given a file name).</p>

I'm looking for some way to list just the directories contained within another directory over FTP, though.

I don't really see a downside to good, well thought out syntactic sugar.  Why do some people basically think that syntactic sugar is at best superfluous and at worst something to be avoided?</p>

<p>Edit:  I didn't want to name names, but since people asked, it seems like most C++ and Java programmers, for example, frankly don't care about their language's utter lack of syntactic sugar.  In a lot of cases, it's not necessarily that they just like other parts of the language enough to make the lack of sugar worth the tradeoff, it's that they really <strong>don't care</strong>.  Also, Lisp programmers seem almost proud of their language's strange notation (I won't call it syntax because it technically isn't), though in this case, it's more understandable because it allows Lisp's metaprogramming facilities to be as powerful as they are.</p>

  slots 'setValue(int)'

Now, I don't know much about either Windows APIs or VB(A) programming, but the ""standard"" Windows file dialog I see most often in Microsoft applications would seem like an obvious choice, but it does not seem to be easily available from Outlook's macros.</p>

<p><em>What are the best choices for directory pickers in Outlook macros?</em></p>

<p>Two things I already tried and did not find totally satisfactory are (the code is simplified and w/o error handling and probably also runs in older Outlook versions):</p>

<p>1) Using <code>Shell.Application</code> which does not allow me to actually paste a starting point via the clipboard or do other operations like renaming folders:</p>

<pre><code>  Set objShell = CreateObject(""Shell.Application"")
  sMsg = ""Select a Folder""
  cBits = 1
  xRoot = 17
  Set objBFF = objShell.BrowseForFolder(0, sMsg, cBits, xRoot)
  path = objBFF.self.Path
</code></pre>

<p>2) Using the <code>Office.FileDialog</code> from <code>Microsoft Word 12.0 Object Library</code> (via tools/references) and then using Word's file dialog, which somehow takes forever on my Vista system to appear and does not always actually bring Word to the foreground. Instead, sometimes Outlook is blocked and the file dialog is left lingering somewhere in the background:</p>

<pre><code>  Dim objWord As Word.Application
  Dim dlg As Office.FileDialog
  Set objWord = GetObject(, ""Word.Application"")
  If objWord Is Nothing Then
     Set objWord = CreateObject(""Word.Application"")

<p>EDIT:  Thanks everyone for the input so far!  I know this sounds impossible.  I'd be happy if there was some conditional comment or something so I can tell IE to suppress this dialog box.  It confuses our customer since most of the world is in IE, FF has much better behavior in that it tells you if you click the broken lock, but not an annoying popoup.  This is like a new version of ""your program has performed an illegal operation."" (user hides from police)  I am embedding youtube video onto the page where the src is from youtube.  I am using their player, as it is hosted by them.  No way out of this that I see.</p>

<p>I guess my fix is to only apply HTTPS to the very sensitive pages (password change, login) and come out of it in all others so youtube videos don't give this popup.

    void RaiseFooValueChanged(IFooView sender, FooEventArgs  e);

<p>I cannot have the FooValueChanged event abstract, because then the base class cannot raise  the event. Current the code runs, but the call FooValueChanged(sender, e) throws a NullReferenceException because it doesn't call the derived class's event, only that of the base class.</p>

<p>Where am I going wrong?</p>

<p>I can have the event and the raiser both abstract, but then I need to remember to call FooValueChanged(sender, e) in every single derived class. I'm trying to avoid this while being able to use the Visual Studio designer for derived controls.</p>

He wants end-users to receive an 8- or 9- digit (digits only -- no characters) ""random"" number. Obviously, this ""random"" number actually has to be unique and reversible (it's really an encryption of the actualOrderNumber). </p>

<p>My first thought was to just shuffle some bits. When I showed the client a sample sequence, he complained that subsequent obfuscOrderNumbers were increasing until they hit a ""shuffle"" point (point where the lower-order bits came into play). He wants the obfuscOrderNumbers to be as random-seeming as possible.</p>

<p>My next thought was to deterministically seed a linear congruential pseudo-random-number generator and then take the actualOrderNumber th value. But in that case, I need to worry about collisions -- the client wants an algorithm that is guaranteed not to collide in at least 10^7 cycles. </p>

<p>My third thought was ""eh, just encrypt the darn thing,"" but if I use a stock encryption library, I'd have to post-process it to get the 8-or-9 digits only requirement.</p>

<p>My fourth thought was to interpret the bits of actualOrderNumber as a Gray-coded integer and return that. </p>

<p>Three entities:
Cust (custid, custname)
Ord (ordid, custid, orddate, ...)
Charge (chargeid, ordid, chargetype, chargevalue...)</p>

<p>Think of a ""charge"" as an optional cost (a special charge) associated with an order -- some orders have them, some don't.</p>

<p>Model was auto-generated from views (.dsv) which accurately indicate the relationships between cust and ord, and between ord and charge. I noted that when designing the view relationships there was no kind of option to indicate (for example) that the relationship should be treated as a ""left join"".  </p>

<p>Now I jump to Report Builder 2 (RB2) to design a report based on this model.  My goal is to simply list for each order: customer name, order date, charge type, charge value (i.e., order row would repeat if it had more than one charge type).  I want ALL orders listed, even if an order doesn't have any charges -- what I would consider a ""left join"" in the traditional sense.</p>

<p>I use RB2's Query Designer to create the dataset, and merely select (i.e., double-click) the entities I want as fields in the report: custname, orddate, chargetype, chargeval.  I then create a simple table in the report based on this dataset.</p>

<p>When running the report, I get only those orders which actually have charges.  I was rather hoping to get all orders.  Is there a way I can specify that?</p>

<p>Thank you,

I'm starting to notice that I need to call the IoC container in different places in my code to create new objects. This dependency on the container makes my code harder to maintain.</p>

<p>There are two solutions I've used to solve this problem</p>

<p>I tried to create abstract factories as wrappers around the container that I could inject into parts of my application that need to create objects. This works but has some drawbacks because castle has a hard time injecting it's own container as a dependency. So I have to do that by hand, this kind of defeats the whole purpose of the IoC container.</p>

<p>I have used the main applicationcontroller class to wrap the IoC container and work as a central factory/repository. This was quite succesfull but this class is getting too big and acts like a central god-object, almost every other objects has a reference to it.</p>

<p>Both solutions sort of work but both have their drawbacks. So I'm curious if other people had the same problem and have found better solutions.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>edit</em>
The problem isn't for object A that depends on object B. Here I usually just use constructor injection and everything works. Sometimes I have objects of type A that need to create a variable number of other objects of type B during their lifetime. I'm not sure how to do this.</p>

<p>@Blair Conrad: The maintenance issues are not severe until now. I had some classes depend on the container object calling container.Resolve&lt;>. And I don't want to have my code depending on what I think is infrastructure. I'm still trying things out so I noticed I had to change a lot of code when switching from ninject to castle for this project.</p>

<p>@flowers: Hmm. I like your fists solution. It combines the things that work from both solutions I've tried. I think I was still thinking too much in objects and not enough in interfaces/responsibilities. 
I tried purpose built factories but I would like to have them use the container behind the scenes to create the objects and I havn't found out how I can DI the container into objects in a clean way.</p>
