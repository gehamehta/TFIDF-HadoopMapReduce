<p>I would like to build a custom tag, which can produce multiple copies of its children.
Ultimately I intend to build a tag similar to  in JSP/Struts.</p>

<p>But the first hurdle I have is the ability to duplicate/clone the contents of a control.</p>

<p>Consider this rather contrived example;</p>

<pre><code>&lt;custom:duplicate count=""2""&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some html&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;asp:TextBox id=""tb1"" runat=""server"" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/custom:duplicate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The HTML markup which is output would be something like,</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some html&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" id=""tb1"" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some html&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" id=""tb1"" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note: I know i have the id duplicated, I can come up with a solution to that later!</em></p>

<p>So what we would have is my custom control with 3 children (I think) - a literal control, a TextBox control, and another literal control.</p>

<p>In this example I have said 'count=2' so what the control should do is output/render its children twice.</p>

<p>What I would hope to do is write some ""OnInit"" code which does something like:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;WebControl&gt; clones;
for(int i=1; i&lt;count; i++)
{
    foreach(WebControl c in Controls) 
    {
        WebControl clone = c.Clone();
        clones.Add(clone);
    }
}

Controls.AddRange(clones);
</code></pre>

<p>However, as far as I can tell, WebControls do not implement ICloneable, so its not possible to clone them in this way.</p>

<p>Any ideas how I can clone WebControls?</p>

<p>This works, but filters more than just .html -- it could block other pages. Unfortunately,</p>

<p>Hi, all!</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there's a way to force the serialization of an enum value into its integer value, instead of its string representation.</p>

<p>To put you into context:
We're using, in a web application that heavily relies on web services, a single baseclass  for all our request headers, independantly of the type of request.  </p>

<p>I want to add a Result field to the header, so we'll have a place to pass hints back to the calling app as to how the operation went on the web service side.  We already have an enum declared to that effect, but since we have legacy apps that call on those web services that may not know about those enums, I'd like to send serialize those values as integers.</p>

<p>We've already had to cut down on the length of those headers by using the [XmlElement(ElementName = ""string representationOfAttributeName"")] because we occasionally exceeded IE maximum url length, and I wondered whether there's a similar Attributes to force the serialization of enum values into integers.</p>

<p>Anyone ever heard of such an attribute?</p>

<p>As ever, thanks for the help,
Pascal</p>

<p>In the previous simplified example, the 'this' keyword used in the Javascript function won't reference the generated A HREF element, but will reference to the global window, because JSF generates the following (simplified) code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a onclick=""var a=function(){alert(this)};var b=function(){if(typeof jsfcljs == 'function'){jsfcljs(document.forms['mainForm'],'generatedId,action,action','');}return false};return (a()==false) ? false : b();"" href=""#"" id=""generatedId""&gt;text&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So because JSF wraps the user defined onclick in a function, this will point to the global window. I don't have access to the id of the element because my code is used in a generic component that can be used in loops etc. and I don't use backing beans (Facelets + JSF).</p>

<p>So my question is, is there a way to access the A HREF element from within my onclick javascript function, without knowing the id?</p>

This works wonderfully in most cases, however:</p>

<p>I have a view with no single unique key. Let's say the underlying tables look like this:</p>

<p>A:<br/>
id,varX<br/>
1,""Blah""<br/>
2,""Foo""<br/>
3,""Bar""<br/></p>

<p>B:<br/>
id,A.id,C.id<br/>
1,2,1<br/>
2,2,2<br/>
3,3,1<br/></p>

<p>C:<br/>
id,varY<br/>
1,""Boom""<br/>
2,""Fizzle""<br/></p>

<p>My view looks like this:<br/>
A.id,varX,B.id,C.id,varY<br/>
1,""Blah"",NULL,NULL,NULL<br/>
2,""Foo"",1,1,""Boom""<br/>
2,""Foo"",2,2,""Fizzle""<br/>
3,""Bar"",3,1,""Boom""<br/></p>

<p>That is exactly how it ought to look for our purposes. However, as you can see, the best unique composite id we could construct for the view is ['A.id','C.id'], as this uniquely identifies each element, but Grails fails because it cannot seem to deal with part of a composite ID being NULL (actually, list() returns a list of 4 objects, the first is a null pointer, the rest are actual domain instances of the view).</p>

<p>Note that we could also use A.id and B.id but it suffers from the same problem.</p>

<p>Note also that we WANT to display elements from table A at least once (with null values for any fields not found in tables B/C), possibly many times if there are multiple corresponding entries in table B.</p>

<p><strong>So, my question is 2 parts:<br/>
1: Is it possible to define a grails domain class without any ID field at all? We do not need a permanent handle to any of the views entries, we just need to list the data in that view.<br/>
2: If not, is it possible to define a grails domain class with a composite ID field, part of which may be NULL, but which will uniquely identify a row anyway even if part of the composite ID is NULL?</strong></p>

<p>I know we can use straight Groovy SQL to query the view directly without an associated domain class (we are doing this now actually), but ideally we'd like to represent the view with a domain class. Further, all arguments aside, these two questions can be applied much more generically than to just our particular problem.</p>

<pre><code>create table activity (

  created smalldatetime not null default getutcdate()
);

create table activity_details (
  sessionid uniqueidentifier not null,

<p>My goal is to populate a summary table for reporting purposes that looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>create table activity_summary (

  first_activity_desc varchar(100) not null,
  last_activity_desc varchar(100) not null
);

<p>First and last activity descriptions would be determined chronologically. My initial thought is to update the summary table like so:</p>

<pre><code>truncate table activity_summary;

insert into activity_summary (sessionid)
select sessionid from activity;

update table activity_summary set
  first_activity_desc = (select top 1 activity_desc from activity_detail where sessionid = as.sessionid order by created asc),
  last_activity_summary = (select top 1 activity_desc from activity_detail where sessionid = as.sessionid order by created desc)
from activity_summary as;

<p>However, this seems incredibly verbose and unnecessary to me. I'm just not sure how to shrink it down. My gut feel is that I could do it somehow all within the insert statement, but I'm stumped. Any suggestions?  </p>

<p>Is something like the following possible? If not is there any plans to have it in .NET 4 / C# 4?</p>

<pre><code>public string Name

<p>The main issue I have is that using auto properties doesn't allow for the same flexibility in validation etc. that a property with a explicit backing field does. However an explicit backing field has the disadvantage in some situations of allowing the class it is contained in to access the backing field when it should be accessing and reusing the validation, change tracking etc. of the property just like any other class that may be accessing the property externally.</p>

<p>In the example above access to the backing field would be scoped to the property thus preventing circumvention of the property validation, change tracking etc.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I've changed &lt; Backing Field > to &lt; Keyword >. I would propose a new keyword similar to value. <strong>field</strong> would do nicely although I'm sure it's being used in a lot of existing code.</p>

My initial idea was to write some code to override some functions, which would take the original function (perhaps, if possible, <em>call</em> the function), and then add some of my own code.  The key is that the function that I write has to have the name of the original function, so other code, upon trying to access it, will access mine instead.</p>

<p>I can easily (comparatively) do this directly in the kernel by just throwing my code into the appropriate functions, but I was wondering if anyone knew a little C magic that isn't <em>necessarily</em> horrible kernel (or C) coding practice that could achieve the same result.</p>

<p>Thoughts of #defines and typedefs come to mind, but I can't quite hack it out in my head.</p>

<p>In short: does anyone know a way to effectively override functions in the Linux kernel (from a module)?</p>

<p>EDIT: Since it's been asked, I essentially want to log certain functions (creating/deleting directories, etc.) <em>from within the kernel</em>, but for sanity's sake, a loadable module seems to make sense, rather than having to write a big patch to the kernel code and recompile on every change.  A minimal amount of added code to the kernel is okay, but I want to offload most of the work to a module.</p>

<p>It was a namespace issue, the problem was that I didn't declare <em>default</em> namespace in myNamespaceContext at all! Just by adding </p>

<p>So wouldn't that mean that setting it to 6.25% would equate to 1em = 1px? Seems like an even simpler conversion rather than having to mess with decimals...</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks guys! I'm quite aware of the em and it's history (design degree), but I'm sure others may find it helpful :)</p>

<p>As far as the 1em = 1px, I don't see how this is undesirable. The em is square, regardless of your units (be it points or pixels) and nobody would set their type at 1px (just like nobody would set printed type at 1pt). Furthermore, even your article concedes that in most digital typefaces, the capital ""M"" is usually smaller than 1em, and that the em is merely a reflection of the point size (48pt type would render a 48pt by 48pt square for the em, 12pt type would yield 12x12, etc.)</p>

<p>Besides, the reason people would do this would be more for setting dimensions of other elements on the page so that everything scales nicely when the user adjusts their font size. Sure, there will always be the rare few who set their default to something other than 16px, but well worth the price to pay for a pixel perfect layout that scales nicely.</p>

The reason for this is so that I can catch every exception at the point of infraction and log it. I understand, from my reading and conversations with others, that this isn’t a popular view. One should only catch what one is prepared to handle. However, if I don’t catch at the point of infraction, then it would be possible to never log that infraction and know about it. Note: When I do catch and don’t handle, I still throw. This allows me to let the exception propagate to something that will handle it, yet still let me log it at the point of infraction.</p>

In the actual code I'm writing I need to build a few variables and reference them within the scope of the if/else.  I could switch this to use labels and gotos instead of an if/else, but that doesn't seem nearly as clean.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= Person.Name %&gt;

<p>Which was fine with webforms as alot of model data was bound to controls programatically. But with MVC we are now using this syntax more oftern. </p>

<p>The issue I have with it is quite trivial, but annoying either way. This is that it seems to break up the mark up i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% foreach(var Person in People) { %&gt;
    &lt;%= Person.Name %&gt;
&lt;% } %&gt;

<p>That seems like alot of opening and closing tags to me!</p>

<p>Other view engines in the MVC contrib have a means of spitting to screen with out opening and closing the script tags using standard keyword such as ""print, out, echo"" i.e. (brail example):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% 
for element in list:
      output ""&lt;li&gt;${element}&lt;/li&gt;"" 
end

<p>I have tried triggers, but they didn't work..</p>

<p>When i press btnSave this is the code that's executed:</p>

<pre><code>    protected void btnSave_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {

        lblTitleError.Text = ""BUTTON PRESSED"";

<p>When i set a breakpoint, it runs the code. But the label text isn't set :S</p>

<p>Hope someone can help?</p>

<p>Basically I am trying to establish if I can navigate through my script using conditionals. It seems apparent that I am getting some issues with variable scope and delayed variable expansion yet I'm a little lost on what I'm doing wrong.</p>

<p>The application need to prefetch a batch of 100 IDs from a sequence. It's relatively easy to do in a single-threaded, non-distributed environment, you can just issue these queries:</p>

<pre><code>select seq.nextval from dual;
alter sequence seq increment by 100;
select seq.nextval from dual;
</code></pre>

<p>The first select fetches the first sequence ID that the application can use, the second select returns the last one that can be used.</p>

<p>Things get way more interesting in a multithreaded environment. You can't be sure that before the second select another thread doesn't increase the sequence by 100 again. This issue can be solved by synchronizing the access on the Java side - you only let one thread begin fetching the IDs at one time.</p>

<p>The situation becomes really hard when you can't synchronize because parts of the application doesn't run on the same JVM, not even on the same physical machine. I found some references on forums that others have problems with solving this problem too, but none of the answers are really working not to mention being reasonable.</p>

<p>Can the community provide a solution for this problem?</p>

<p>Some more information:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can't really play with the transaction isolation levels. I use JPA and the change would affect the entire application, not only the prefetching queries and that's not acceptable for me.</li>
<li><p>On PostgreSQL I could do the following:</p>

<p>select setval('seq', nextval('seq') + n - 1 )</p></li>
<li><p>The solution by Matthew works when you can use a fixed increment value (which is perfectly acceptable in my case). However is there a solution when you don't want to fix the size of the increment, but want to adjust it dynamically?</p></li>

"276362","1","277015","","2008-11-09 19:35:21","","18","7033","<p>I'm working on a project for OSX where the user can pick a collection of documents (from any application) which I need to generate PDF's from.  The standard Macintosh Print dialog has a PDF button which has a number of PDF-related commands including ""Save as PDF..."". However, I need to generate the PDF file without requiring user interactions. I ideally want this to work with any type of document.</p>

<p>Here's the options I've explored so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automator actions. There's a PDF library for Automator but it provides actions for working with PDF files, not generating them. There's a Finder action for printing any file but only to a real printer.</li>
<li>AppleScript. Some applications have the ability to generate PDF files (for instance, if you send 'save doc in ""test.pdf""' to Pages it will generate a PDF (but this only works for Pages - I need support for any type of document).</li>
<li>Custom Printer. I could create a virtual printer driver and then use the automator action but I don't like the idea of confusing the user with an extra printer in the print list.</li>
</ul>

<p>My hope is that there's some way to interact with the active application as if the user was carrying out the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do Cmd-P (opens the print dialog)</li>
<li>Click the ""PDF"" button</li>
<li>Select ""Save as PDF..."" (second item in menu)</li>
<li>Type in filename in save dialog</li>
<li>Click ""Save""</li>
</ol>

<p>If that's the best approach (is it?) then the real problem is: how do I send UI Events to an external application (keystrokes, mouse events, menu selections) ?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Just to clarify one point: the documents I need to convert to PDF are documents that are created by <em>other applications</em>. For example, the user might pick a Word document or a Numbers spreadsheet or an OmniGraffle drawing or a Web Page. The common denominator is that each of these documents has an associated application and that application knows how to print it (and OSX knows how to render print output to a PDF file).</p>

<p>So, the samples at Cocoa Dev Central don't help because they're about generating a PDF from <em>my application</em>.</p>

When debugging (with the <em>Debug</em> menu <kbd>F5</kbd>) a Visual Studio solution, a process called <code>MyApp.vshost.exe</code> is created. When you stop the debug <em>indecently</em> - I mean using the <em>Stop Debug</em> menu <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> and not waiting for a code line like <code>Application.Exit()</code> occurs - this process is not killed.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when you later start again debugging your application, an error message occurs, saying that the file (obviously, it is the file used by the debug: <code>bin\Debug\MyApp.vshost.exe</code>) is already in use.</p>

<p>That is why I added to the Build events this command line: <code>taskkill /F /IM MyApp.vshost.exe</code></p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong><br>
When the <code>MyApp.vshost.exe</code>process does not exist, Visual Studio is sometimes throwing an error at build time, thus preventing to build the application:  </p>

<pre><code>Error c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Microsoft.Common.targets
The command ""taskkill /F /IM MyApp.vshost.exe"" exited with code 128.
</code></pre>

<p>The only existing solution i found is to remove the build event.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong><br>
Is there a way to resolve the error message without removing the build event?</p>

<h1>EDIT</h1>

<p>I'm thinking the best solution would be to retrieve the return code (<code>errorlevel</code>) of the command, then return 0 if it is equal to 128. Is it possible to do it in the Build events of the project?</p>

<p>I created a test application to compare the performance of both logging methods in several scenarios, and I'm finding that log4net is significantly slower than the <code>Trace</code> class.  For example, in a scenario where I log 1,000 messages with no string formatting, log4net's mean execution time over 1,000 trials is 9.00ms.  <code>Trace</code> executes with a mean of 1.13ms.  A lot of my test cases have a relatively large amount of variance in the log4net execution times; the periodic nature of outlier long executions seems to suggest GC interference.  Poking around with CLR Profiler confirms there are a large amount of collections for a ton of <code>log4net.Core.LoggingEvent</code> objects that are generated (to be fair, it looks like <code>Trace</code> generates a ton of <code>Char[]</code> objects as well, but it doesn't display the large variance that log4net does.)</p>

<p>One thing I'm keeping in mind here are that even though log4net seems roughly 9 times slower than <code>Trace</code>, the difference is 8ms over 1,000 iterations; this isn't exactly a significant performance drain.  Still, some of my expected use cases might be calling methods that are logging things hundreds of thousands of times, and these numbers are from my fast machine.  On a slower machine more typical of our users' configurations the difference is 170ms to 11ms which is a tiny bit more alarming.</p>

<p>Is this performance typical of log4net, or are there some gotchas that can significantly increase log4net's performance?</p>

<p>(<em>NOTE: I am aware that string formatting can alter the execution time; I am trying to compare apples to apples and I have test cases with no formatting and test cases with formatting; log4net stays as proportionally slow whether string formatting is used or not.</em>)</p>

<p>The story so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Robert Gould has the best answer to the question; I was mainly curious if it was typical to see log4net perform much slower than the <code>Trace</code> class.</li>
<li>Alex Shnayder's answer is interesting information but doesn't really fall under the scope of the question.  Half of the intent for introducing this logging is to assist in debugging both logical and performance problems on live systems; our customers put our products in many exotic scenarios that are often difficult to reproduce without expensive and large-scale hardware configurations.  My main concern is that a large timing difference between ""not logging"" and ""logging"" could affect the system in such a way that bugs don't happen.  In the end, the scale of the performance decrease is large but the magnitude is small, so I'm hoping it won't be a problem.</li>

<p>I'm looking for something like, ""isPhysical(interface)"".
(It's ok to have multiple physical lan ports, I just want to know if it is a physical port or not).</p>

<p>Jay and Chris thanks!</p>

<p>(Not enough space in the comments so I'll post here)</p>

<p>I'm currently looking at using WMI Win32_NetworkAdapter.
However, it shows 4 interfaces with AdapterType=""Ethernet 802.3"".</p>

<p>I only have 1 phyical port on my pc the others have the Name, ""Virtual Machine Network Services Driver"".  (I assume these are installed by my company for some nefarious reason)</p>

<p>I found the attribute I need in the interface, but it's not available in winXP!!!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PhysicalAdapter Data type: boolean

  <p>Indicates whether the adapter is a

  True, the adapter is physical. <strong>Windows

  and Windows NT 4.0:  This property is
  not available.</strong></p>

<p>Is there any way to determine if it's a physical port, other than doing a text filter for the word ""Virtual"" in the name?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 12/08</strong></p>

<p>Looks like the virtual interfaces are added when you have a VM installed.</p>

<p>Here's some details about the virtual adapter:

<p>Found an issue where if the user doesn't have admin rights the WMI interface doesn't return the data needed.  So, now looking at the GetAdapterInfo method.  However, it seems to add 'virtual machine services driver"" to the actual adapter's description, making the 'virtual' text check invalid.</p>

<p>And the structure returned by GetAdapterInfo:</p>

DAG:</p>

<pre><code>       A*      # I can't ascii-art the arrows, so just
      / \      # pretend the slashes are all pointing
     B   C     # ""down"" (south-east or south-west)
    /   / \    # e.g. 
   G   E   D   # A -&gt; (B -&gt; G, C -&gt; (E -&gt; F, D -&gt; F))
        \ /
         F
</code></pre>

<p>The representation I'm using is immutable truly a DAG (there are no
""parent"" pointers).   I'd like to traverse the graph in some fashion
while building a ""mirror image"" graph with equivalent nodes, but with
the direction of relations between nodes inverted.</p>

<pre><code>         F*
        / \
   G*  E   D   # F -&gt; (E -&gt; C -&gt; A, D -&gt; C -&gt; A), G -&gt; B -&gt; A
    \   \ /    # 
     B   C     # Again, arrows point ""down""
      \ /      # 
       A       # 
</code></pre>

<p>So the input is a set of ""roots"" (here, {A}).  The output should be a
set of ""roots"" in the result graph: {G, F}. (By root I mean a node
with no incoming references. A leaf is a node with no outgoing
references.)</p>

<p>The roots of the input become the leaves of the output and visa
versa. The transformation should be an inverse of itself.</p>

<p>(For the curious, I'd like to add a feature to a library I'm using to
represent XML for structural querying by which I can map each node in
the first tree to its ""mirror image"" in the second tree (and back
again) to provide more navigational flexibility for my query rules.)</p>

<p>What happens is that there is only one node in the tree, and the text of the node is the type name of the object. It sounds like the type bound to the node isn't what the template is expecting, so it's using the default <code>ToString()</code> binding instead of the <code>Text</code> property as I specified.</p>

<p>I have set the DataContext of the Window in the code behind file. I know that my Bindings for the data are correct, because if I set one <code>HierarchicalDataTemplate</code> for the TreeView the data is displayed correctly.</p>

<p>I think that my problem is that I need to set a property other than <code>ItemTemplate</code> in the <code>TreeViewItem</code> styles - am I using the right property, or should I set something else?</p>

<p>The app shows a digital catalog to users and allows them to perform actions like creating and placing orders, among others.
Currently the app only works when online, and we have APIs for all actions like viewing the catalog, creating/placing orders which return JSON data.
We would like to provide offline/synchronization capability to users, through which users can view the catalog and create/place orders while offline, and when they come online the order details will be synchronized and updated to our server.
We would also like to pull the latest data from the server, and have the app keep itself up to date in case of catalog changes or order changes that happened at the Server while the app was offline.
Can you guys help me to come with the best design and approach for handling this kind of functionality?</p>

<p>We have two large files which we'd like to read from two separate threads concurrently.  One thread will sequentially read fileA while the other thread will sequentially read fileB.  There is no locking or communication between the threads, both are sequentially reading as fast as they can, and both are immediately discarding the data they read.</p>

<p>Our experience with this setup on Windows is very poor.  The combined throughput of the two threads is in the order of 2-3 MiB/sec.  The drive seems to be spending most of its time seeking backwards and forwards between the two files, presumably reading very little after each seek.</p>

<p>If we disable one of the threads and temporarily look at the performance of a single thread then we get much better bandwidth (~45 MiB/sec for this machine).  So clearly the bad two-thread performance is an artefact of the OS disk scheduler.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything we can do to improve the concurrent thread read performance?</strong>  Perhaps by using different APIs or by tweaking the OS disk scheduler parameters in some way.</p>

<p>Some details:</p>

<p>The files are in the order of 2 GiB each on a machine with 2GiB of RAM.  For the purpose of this question we consider them not to be cached and perfectly defragmented.  We have used defrag tools and rebooted to ensure this is the case.</p>

<p>We are using no special APIs to read these files.  The behaviour is repeatable across various bog-standard APIs such as Win32's CreateFile, C's fopen, C++'s std::ifstream, Java's FileInputStream, etc.</p>

<p>Each thread spins in a loop making calls to the read function.  We have varied the number of bytes requested from the API each iteration from values between 1KiB up to 128MiB.  Varying this has had no effect, so clearly the amount the OS is physically reading after each disk seek is not dictated by this number.  This is exactly what should be expected.</p>

<p>The dramatic difference between one-thread and two-thread performance is repeatable across Windows 2000, Windows XP (32-bit and 64-bit), Windows Server 2003, and also with and without hardware RAID5.</p>

""We need to lock a .NET Int32 when reading it in a multithreaded code?""</p>

<p>I understand that if it was an Int64 in a 32-bit SO it could tear, as it is explained in the article. But for Int32 I imagined the following situation:</p>

<pre><code>class Test
{
  private int example = 0;
  private Object thisLock = new Object();

  public void Add(int another)
  {

<p><strong>Update</strong> Based on the answers (by Jon Skeet and ctacke) I understand that the code above still vulnerable to multiprocessor caching (each processor has its own cache, unsynchronized with others). All the three modifications bellow fix the problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>Adding to ""int example"" the ""volatile"" property</li>
<li>Inserting a Thread.MemoryBarrier(); before the actual reading of ""int example""</li>
<li>Read ""int example"" inside a ""lock(thisLock)""</li>

<p>In all the examples of the Factory Pattern that I've run across, I always see very simple examples that have no parameterization.

               new Refrigerator())
           );
  }
}

<p>However, what happens if I want each house that I build to have a name?  Am I still using the Factory pattern if I re-write this code as follows?</p>

<pre>
class ApplicationBuilder {
  House build( const std::string & house_name) {
    return new House( house_name,
                      new Kitchen(new Sink(),

                                  new Refrigerator())
                    );
  }
}

<p>Note that my Factory method call has changed from this:</p>

ApplicationBuilder builder;
House * my_house = builder.build();</pre>

<p>To this:</p>

<pre>
ApplicationBuilder builder;
House * my_house = builder.build(""Michaels-Treehouse"");</pre>

<p>By the way: I think the concept of separating object instantiating from business logic is great, I'm just trying to figure out how I can apply it to my own situation.  What confuses me is that all the examples I've seen of the Factory pattern never pass any parameters into the build() function.</p>

<p>To be clear: I don't know the name of the house until the moment before I need to instantiate it.</p>

I did not like the fact that the client had to so much processing and merge the returned data before it was ready to be used and wanted to move that layer to the service and let the service open the asynchronous threads to the suppliers and merge the results before returning them to the client.</p>

<p>One challenge I had was that I could not wait till all threads were complete and results were merged, I had to start receiving data as it was available. That called me to implement an observer pattern on the service so that it would notify my application when new set of results are merged and ready to be used and send them to the application. </p>

<p>I was looking for how to do this using either on ASMX webservices or WCF and so far I have found implementing it using WCF but this thread is always open for suggestions and improvements.</p>

<p>I have found the Adobe Illustrator 3 File Format documentation online but it's allot to digest for this simple scenario.</p>

<p>The code is for an Expression Studio addin, and I need to be able to create something on the clipboard I can paste into Expression Design.

<p>So based on this I can't use SWG which would probably been easier.</p>

<p>Another idea might be to use a PDF component as the AI and PDF format is supposed to be compatible? I'm also finding some references to a format called ""Adobe Illustrator Clipboard Format"" (AICB), but can't find allot of documentation about it.</p>

<p>1) This category uses inheritance on the objects referenced so that they have reference counts and usually up() and down() (or their equivalents) implemented. IE, to use the smart pointer, the objects you're pointing at must inherit from some class the ref implementation provides.</p>

<p>2) This category uses a secondary object to hold the reference counts. For example, instead of pointing the smart pointer right at an object, it actually points at this meta data object... Who has a reference count and up() and down() implementations (and who usually provides a mechanism for the pointer to get at the actual object being pointed to, so that the smart pointer can properly implement operator ->()).</p>

<p>Now, 1 has the downside that it forces all of the objects you'd like to reference count to inherit from a common ancestor, and this means that you cannot use this to reference count objects that you don't have control over the source code to.</p>

<p>2 has the problem that since the count is stored in another object, if you ever have a situation that a pointer to an existing reference counted object is being converted into a reference, you probably have a bug (I.E., since the count is not in the actual object, there is no way for the new reference to get the count... ref to ref copy construction or assignment is fine, because they can share the count object, but if you ever have to convert from a pointer, you're totally hosed)...</p>

<p>Now, as I understand it, boost::shared_pointer uses mechanism 2, or something like it... That said, I can't quite make up my mind which is worse! I have only ever used mechanism 1, in production code... Does anyone have experience with both styles? Or perhaps there is another way thats better than both of these?</p>

I'm using a customized jQuery UI theme built with ThemeRoller.  I've tweaked it some to adjust colors, margins, and borders.  The accordion is located inside a DIV which is, in turn, nested inside my main content.  Simplified mark up  and CSS is below.  Basically the content is a centered box surrounded by borders.  The menu is offset below the top of the box and floats over the left edge.</p>

<p>The problem is that in IE7 once I had hover over the menu, the borders from the underlying <code>main</code> DIV show through the accordion.  This doesn't happen in FF or Safari.  The question is why, since the default accordion CSS sets a z-index of 1?  Shouldn't all of those elements display over the top of the DOM elements behind them?  And why only on hover?</p>

<p>I've already solved this problem and will post the solution as an answer.</p>

the question I'm asking here is quite different.</p>

<p>I'm been trying to understand what exactly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cygwin</a> is, via
Wikipedia and Google, I'm not having much luck.
I've just begun assembly programming on Linux using the gcc
gas assembler. I'm using a machine at work during lunch that
only has Windows on it. I wanted to practice some assembly
language programming here so I thought Cygwin might be able
to help.</p>

<p>Mistakenly I believed that the code I was writing in Linux
could just be compiled and run in Windows using Cygwin.
Cygwin allows me to compile the code fine:</p>

<pre><code>as someAssmProg.as -o someAssmProg.o
ld someAssmProg.o -o someAssmProg
</code></pre>

<p>But if I try to run the code under Cygwin,</p>

<pre><code>./someAssmProg
</code></pre>

<p>I get a ""unhandled win32 exception occured"" message</p>

<p>Now I am assuming this is because the code I'm writing is
intended for Linux. I thought though that Cygwin would deal
with this. Is Cygwin just really meant to be used to develop
Windows applications in a Unix style command line way?</p>

<p>Again I know this is probably obvious to most folks here but
I'm genuinely confused!</p>

<p>The problem is, while I can inject HTML (via mydomdocument.body.insertAdjacentHTML) and Javascript (via mydomdocument.parentWindow.execScript), it is flat-out rejecting my CSS code. </p>

It doesn't do anything too tricky, with the exception that some background-image properties have the image directly embedded into the CSS (e.g. <code>background-image: url(""data:image/png;base64</code> ...), and commenting out those lines doesn't change the result.</p>

<p>More strangely (and I am not sure if this is relevant), was that I was having no problems with this last week. I came back to it this week and, after switching around some of the code that handles the to-be-injected HTML before actual injection, it no longer worked. Naturally I thought that one of my changes might somehow be the problem, but after commenting all that logic out and feeding it a straight string the HTML is still appearing unformatted.</p>

"205458","1","","","2008-10-15 16:42:12","","46","7076","<p>For years, I've been using named blocks to limit the scope of temporary variables.  I've never seen this done anywhere else, which makes me wonder if this is a bad idea.  Especially since the Eclipse IDE flags these as warnings by default.</p>

<p>I've used this to good effect, I think, in my own code.  But since it is un-idiomatic to the point where good programmers will distrust it when they see it, I really have two ways to go from here:  </p>

<ol>
<li>avoid doing it, or </li>
<li>promote it, with the hope that it will become an idiom.</li>
</ol>

<p>Example (within a larger method):</p>

<pre><code>final Date nextTuesday;
initNextTuesday: {
    GregorianCalendar cal = new GregorianCalendar();
    ... // About 5-10 lines of setting the calendar fields
    nextTuesday = cal.getTime();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here I'm using a GregorianCalendar just to initialize a date, and I want to make sure that I don't accidentally reuse it.</p>

<p>Some people have commented that you don't actually need to name the block.  While that's true, a raw block looks even more like a bug, as the intent is unclear.  Furthermore, naming something encourages you to think about the intention of the block.  The goal here is to identify distinct sections of code, not to give every temporary variable its own scope.</p>

<p>Many people have commented that it's best to go straight to small methods.  I agree that this should be your first instinct.  However, there may be several mitigating factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>To even consider a named block, the code should be short, one-off code that will never be called elsewhere.</li>
<li>A named block is a quick way to organize an oversized method without creating a one-off method with a dozen parameters.  This is especially true when a class is in flux, and the inputs are likely to change from version to version.</li>
<li>Creating a new method encourages its reuse, which may be ill-advised if the use cases aren't well-established.  A named block is easier (psychologically, at least) to throw away.</li>
<li>Especially for unit tests, you may need to define a dozen different objects for one-off assertions, and they are just different enough that you can't (yet) find a way to consolidate them into a small number of methods, nor can you think of a way to distinguish them with names that aren't a mile long.</li>
</ul>

<p>Advantages of using the named scope:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can't accidentally reuse temporary variables</li>
<li>Limited scope gives garbage collector and JIT compiler more information about programmer intent</li>
<li>Block name provides a comment on a block of code, which I find more readable than open-ended comments</li>
<li>Makes it easier to refactor code out of a big method into little methods, or vice versa, since the named block is easier to separate than unstructured code.</li>
</ol>

<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<p>Not idiomatic: programmers who haven't seen this use of named blocks (i.e. everyone but me) assume it's buggy, since they can't find references to the block name.  (Just like Eclipse does.)  And getting something to become idiomatic is an uphill battle.</p>

<p>It can be used as an excuse for bad programming habits, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Making huge, monolithic methods where several small methods would be more legible.</li>
<li>Layers of indentation too deep to read easily.</li>
</ul>

  $MyTableRepresentation = DB_DataObject::factory(""mytable"");
  $MyTableRepresentation-&gt;get($id);
  ... do some stuff

<p>...you get the idea.</p>

<p>We're trying to test this method, but mocking the DataObject stuff so that (a) we don't need an actual db connection for the test, and (b) we don't even need to include the DB_DataObject lib for the test.</p>

<p>However, in PHPUnit I can't seem to get $this->getMock() to appropriately set up a static call. I have...</p>

<pre><code>        $DB_DataObject = $this-&gt;getMock('DB_DataObject', array('factory'));

<p>...but the test still says unknown method ""factory"". I know it's creating the object, because before it said it couldn't find DB_DataObject. Now it can. But, no method?</p>

<p>What I really want to do is to have two mock objects, one for the table object returned as well. So, not only do I need to specify that factory is a static call, but also that it returns some specified other mock object that I've already set up.</p>

<p>Question taken from leetcode: <a href=""http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/"">http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/</a></p>

<p>A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:</p>

<pre><code>'A' -&gt; 1
'B' -&gt; 2
...
'Z' -&gt; 26

<p><strong>My solution:</strong></p>

<p>The point with my solution is going backwards and multiplying the number of options if a split is found. By split I mean that digits can be interpreted in two ways. For example: 11 can interpreted in two ways 'aa' or 'k'.</p>

<p>I am trying to use <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/nunit-extmethods/"" rel=""noreferrer"">NUnit ExtensionMethods</a> but whenever I run a test containing one of the extension methods using TestDriven.Net or if I just flat out try to load the assembly using a test-runner GUI (Icarus or NUnit) I get a FileNotFoundException.</p>

<p>Pounding head against a wall and digging in further I think I know what's wrong.  Cue reflector and yep, I can see that NUnit.Framework>ExtensionMethods.dll has a reference to </p>

<pre><code>nunit.framework, Version=2.4.6.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=96d09a1eb7f44a77
</code></pre>

<p>and my current version of nunit that I'm including is</p>

<pre><code>nunit.framework, Version=2.4.8.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=96d09a1eb7f44a77
</code></pre>

<p>Now I have never used assembly re-direction before but it seems like it would be a simple matter of adding an App.Config with the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;runtime&gt;
        &lt;assemblyBinding  xmlns=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1""&gt;
            &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;
                &lt;assemblyIdentity
                    name=""nunit.framework.dll""
                    publicKeyToken=""96d09a1eb7f44a77"" /&gt;
                &lt;bindingRedirect oldVersion=""2.4.6.0"" newVersion=""2.4.8.0"" /&gt;
            &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;
        &lt;/assemblyBinding&gt;
    &lt;/runtime&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and it is my understanding that calls to the 2.4.6 version (which does not exist on this machine) should automatically redirect to the 2.4.8 version.</p>

<p>This does not work however, and I suspect (but have not yet confirmed) that this is because test runners do not automatically read app.config files.</p>

<p>So my question's are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Am I right in my diagnosis of the
problem?</p></li>
<li><p>Is assembly redirection the
    appropriate solution and am I doing
    it right?</p></li>
<li><p>How do I get this to work with the
test runner?</p></li>

<p>I realize that HTTP 500 errors just mean that an unexpected server error occurred, and that this also is more than likely the ASP code crashing for one reason or another. I have tried numerous browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) but they all have the same amount of information.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I neglected to mention in my original posting that it was my unit tests that were failing. I have since learned that AbstractFlowExecutionTests does not implement binding of request parameters. This seems like a bit of an oversight to me. I have tried latest nightly Spring WebFlow 2.0.4 and the behaviour remains the same.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> My problems are that Spring WebFlow mocks do not simulate form submission. </p>

We extended it somewhat to add some authentication data we needed and for the most part this has been great.</p>

<p>The issue we are having is that the context we are giving to the controller has a null value in the HttpContext.Response.Output, which is causing some exceptions to be thrown. I'm not sure what to add to get this working.</p>

<p>Here is the existing FakeHttpConext() method:</p>

<pre><code>public static HttpContextBase FakeHttpContext()
{
    var context = new Mock&lt;HttpContextBase&gt;();
    var request = new Mock&lt;HttpRequestBase&gt;();
    var response = new Mock&lt;HttpResponseBase&gt;();
    var session = new Mock&lt;HttpSessionStateBase&gt;();
    var server = new Mock&lt;HttpServerUtilityBase&gt;();

    // Our identity additions ...
    var user = new Mock&lt;IPrincipal&gt;();
    OurIdentity identity = (OurIdentity)Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity;

    context.Expect(ctx =&gt; ctx.Request).Returns(request.Object);
    context.Expect(ctx =&gt; ctx.Response).Returns(response.Object);
    context.Expect(ctx =&gt; ctx.Session).Returns(session.Object);
    context.Expect(ctx =&gt; ctx.Server).Returns(server.Object);
    context.Expect(ctx =&gt; ctx.User).Returns(user.Object);
    context.Expect(ctx =&gt; ctx.User.Identity).Returns(identity);
    return context.Object;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the exploding method (which is part of the MVC Contrib project's XmlResult):</p>

<pre><code>public override void ExecuteResult(ControllerContext context)
{
    if (_objectToSerialize != null)
    {
       var xs = new XmlSerializer(_objectToSerialize.GetType());
       context.HttpContext.Response.ContentType = ""text/xml"";
       xs.Serialize(context.HttpContext.Response.Output, _objectToSerialize);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>What do I need to add in the FakeHttpContext method to prevent the null exception when the context.HttpContext.Response.Output is referenced?</p>

<p><strong>Clarification: The solution I'm looking for needs to be done in Moq, not Rhino.</strong> I mentioned Moq in the question title but neglected that in question body.  Sorry for any confusion.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong>
I added the following two lines of code to the FakeHttpContext() method:</p>

<pre><code>var writer = new StringWriter();
context.Expect(ctx =&gt; ctx.Response.Output).Returns(writer);
</code></pre>

<p>This prevents the null exception.  Not sure if its a good answer long term, but it works for now.</p>

<p>The mapping is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public class TripItemMap : ClassMap&lt;TripItem2&gt;
{
    public TripItemMap()
    {
        WithTable(""TripItemsInt"");
        NotLazyLoaded();

        Map(x =&gt; x.ModifyDate, ""LastModified"").CanNotBeNull();

        /* snip */

        HasManyToMany&lt;TripItemAttributeValue&gt;(x =&gt; x.Attributes).AsBag()
            .WithTableName(""TripItems_TripItemAttributeValues_Link"")
            .WithParentKeyColumn(""TripItemId"")
            .WithChildKeyColumn(""TripItemAttributeValueId"")
            .LazyLoad();
    }
}

public class TripItemAttributeValueMap : ClassMap&lt;TripItemAttributeValue&gt;
{
    public TripItemAttributeValueMap()
    {
        WithTable(""TripItemAttributeValues"");

        Id(x =&gt; x.Id).GeneratedBy.Identity();
        Map(x =&gt; x.Name).CanNotBeNull();

        HasManyToMany&lt;TripItem2&gt;(x =&gt; x.TripItems).AsBag()

            .WithChildKeyColumn(""TripItemId"")
            .LazyLoad();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>At some point in my application I fetch existing attributes from the database, add them to tripItem.Attributes, then save the tripItem object. In the end, the TripItems_TripItemAttributeValues_Link never gets any new records, resulting in the relations not being persisted.</p>

The goal here is to draw a 4 pixel wide outline around a child ListView under certain circumstances.  I would like to make the outline pulsate when something can be dragged into it.  </p>

<p>I am just drawing a simple rectangle around the ListView and updating the opacity of the rectangle inside of a timer tick event.  When the opacity is changed, the border is re-drawn.  I am double-buffering the painting at this point.  I am also only allowing a redraw every 15 ticks or so (the timer interval is 20 ms).  After all of this, the drawing process still flickers a bit.  This is not acceptable, so I need some guidance on how I could avoid this.</p>

<p>I don't see a way around painting the control quite often.  There needs to be a smooth transition from opaque to solid and back again.  When I lower the tick interval enough (down to about 300 -500 ms), the flashing stops, but the refresh rate is too slow.</p>

<p>I am open to any and all ideas.  Perhaps the way I am approaching this is just plain wrong, or perhaps one of you have already created a glow effect and know what to do.  Thanks for any help in advance.</p>

However, in some cases this has resulted in the need to write a function like typeToString($const) when a string representation is needed. Obviously this is inefficient and unneccesary, but is only an issue every once and a while.</p>

<p>So my question is, are there any other tradeoffs I should consider? Which case is considered to be cleaner/more standards-compliant? Also, is the performance difference negligable for most cases?</p>

<p><strong>Case 1: (faster when a string version is not needed?)</strong></p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
    const USER_TYPE_ADMIN = 0;
    const USER_TYPE_USER = 1;

<p>If the DFM file is the problem, and is corrupted, rolling back will have to be a roll-back WAY back, and that's gonna be expensive.  Given that the IDE can still load it, is there any utility that can clean up the file?</p>

<p>Or, am I totally off base w/the DFM as primary suspect?</p>

<p>Thanks folks for the input.  Forgot about the binary/text options w/DFM files, so that was helpful.  It looks like the DFM itself is not corrupted.</p>

<p>Still having the EClassError issue though. re: It being missing property values, or referencing non-existing properties, etc., a further question: Is the class the error is given for (currently TnxSqlUpdateObject, but probably more waiting in the wings if experience thus far is consistent) usually/always the actual ""culprit"" class/object?  </p>

<p>For instance, right now my main form has four references to  TnxSqlUpdateObject, w/those actually dropped on the form.  If I put RegisterClass(TnxSqlUpdateObject) in the initialization section, it runs fine for that EClassNotFound error but then goes on to the next one (in this case, TStringField).  </p>

<p>I have reinstalled the NexusDB components in this case, and also built a new project using some of the components I thought might be the problem.  It compiles and runs fine, UNTIL I add this other form from my real project (which, in turn, unfortunately references quite a few others).</p>

<p>SO, it sounds like my real issue is how to methodically diagnose and fix any and all EClassNotFound errors?</p>

<p>Seems simple enough. When doing a sync, I tire of entering my password for each sync, each repo. I seem to recall knowing how to do it somewhere once upon a time, but shy of going in and updating EACH project's syncing URLs, is there another method? That'll be tedious, so I'm somewhat loathe to goto each project and update each one.</p>

    val -= val % lround(pow(10, power + 1));

<p>Since there is no need to poll when nothing happens, I wonder, is there something that could do the same thing without frequent polling? Eg. Comet, though I heard that you need to configure server side applications for Comet. It's a shared webserver, so I can't do that.</p>

<p>Maybe prevent the handler.php file from even returning a response if nothing has to be changed at the client, is that possible? Then again you'd still have the client uselessly asking for a response even though something hasn't changed yet.

The data is split up into zip files for individual counties and I've downloaded a single counties map-data for my area.</p>

<p><strong>What would be the best way to read in this map-data into a useable format?</strong> </p>

<p>How should I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read in these files</li>
<li>Parse them - Regular expression or some library that can already parse these Shapefiles?</li>
<li>Load the data into my application - Should I load the points directly into some datastructure in memory?  Use a small database?   I have no need for persistence once you close the application of the map data.  The user can load the Shapefile again.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What would be the best way to render the map once I have read the in the Shapefile data?</strong></p>

<p>Ideally I'd like to be able to read in a counties map data shapefile and render all the poly-lines onto the screen and allow rotating and scaling.</p>

<p>How should I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Convert lat/lon points to screen coordinates?  - As far as I know the Shapefile uses longitude and latitude for its points.  So obviously I'm going to have to convert these somehow to screen coordinates to display the map features.</li>
<li>Render the map data (A series of polylines for roads, boundaries, etc) in a way that I can easily rotate and scale the entire map?</li>
<li>Render my whole map as a series of ""tiles"" so only the features/lines within the viewing area are rendered?</li>
</ul>

<p>Ex. of TIGER data rendered as a display map:<br>

learned Lisp, as I was not a CS major in college. </p>

<p>While SICP does not emphasize the tools for programming, doing the
exercises entails picking a Lisp-like language to use. It seems like
some implementation of <a href=""http://plt-scheme.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Scheme</a> would be the path of least
resistance. On the other hand, I hear of others who have used <a href=""http://gigamonkeys.com/book/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Common

more likely to be used in production code, and therefore slightly
better for my resume. BTW, I fully get the argument that learning a
language is worthwhile for its own sake, but learning a language that
helps my resume is still a benefit. I'm a capitalist and an academic
about my learning.</p>

<p>If you had to self-study SICP, which language would you pick and why?
Ideally, I would like to use a language that can run on the JVM.
I can certainly work with a language where REPL works with bash
and emacs.</p>

<p>Application is written in .NET 1.1 but the server runs ASP.NET 2.0.  Thanx.</p>

<p>Update: Meant to say ASP.NET 2.0 is installed but the default website folder, and the websites inside the folder, are set to ASP.NET 1.1.  On the website folder the ISAPI Filter is set to ASP.NET 2.0.  My first guess about the problem was having ASP.NET 1.1 and ASP.NET 2.0 running side by side.</p>

<p>Update 2: ASP.NET 2.0 is installed but all the websites run only ASP.NET 1.1 (long story and happened before I started).</p>

This is fine because the only columns we use for display are mapped, however I was wondering if there is any way to query against other columns in the table that aren't mapped to properties in my class.</p>

<p>For example we have a table with the following columns:</p>

<p>and <code>name</code> and <code>customerId</code> are mapped however <code>DateCreated</code> is not because we never display it anywhere. We would like to query the <code>Customer</code> table for customers that were created by a certain date. Is there any way to do this <strong>without</strong> mapping the <code>DateCreated</code>?  Also it would be preferable to do this using the criteria API.</p>

<p>Here's the tricky part. While most of the validation is being done via javascript, the username and email need to be validated via ajax to see if the username/email is already in use or not.</p>

<p>What can I do to make it work, i.e can I stop the validateSomething() function from returning a value until its set to true/false by the inner function?</p>

<p>Would something like this work:</p>

  });
  //Loop without returning until valid is set to true or false
  while (valid=='unset')
  {
     //Do nothing?

I'm writing a data provider that SSAS will use to get data from a third-party system.<BR>
I wrote a tool that will build cubes, dimensions, measure groups and measures based on the configuration of the third-party system using AMO.
<P>
Now, in the Cube Browser, I am able to pull the members of the dimensions, however, measure data is never queried - I know this because my data provider will log all SQL queries SSAS requests from it.
<P>
So, how do I diagnose this? What are the configuration steps for measures (this is just a regular, 1:1 measure against a single-key dimension - VERY simple cube).
<P>
As far as I can tell, my relationships are the same as a working dimension and measure, and I don't get any errors from SSAS or the event logs, just silence and a set of empty cells in the Cube browser.
<P>
Thoughts?</p>

<p>Database A (Access database) - Holds a table that has information I need from only two columns. The information from these two columns is needed for an application that will be used by people that cannot access database A.</p>

<p>Database B (Access database) - Holds a table that contains only two columns (mirrors to what we need from table A). Database B is accessible to all users of the application. One issue is that on of the column names is not the same as it is in the table from Database A.</p>

<p>What I need to do is transfer the necessary data via a utility that will run automatically, say once a week (the two databases don't need to be totally in sync, just close). The transfer utility will be run from a user account that has access to both databases (obviously).</p>

<p>Here's the approach I've taken (again if there is a better way, please suggest away):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Grab the data from database A. It is only the two columns from the necessary table.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the data out to [tablename].txt file using a DataReader object and WriterStream object. I've done this so I can use a schema.ini file and force the data columns to have the same name as they will be in Database B.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a DataSet object, containing a DataTable that mirrors the table from Database B.</p></li>
<li><p>Suck the information from the .txt file into the DataTable using the Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0 provider with extended properties of text, hdr=yes and fmt=delimited (to match how I have the schema.ini file setup and the .txt file setup). I'm using a DataAdapter to fill the DataTable.</p></li>
<li><p>Create another DataSet object, containing a DataTable that mirrors the table from Database B. </p></li>
<li><p>Suck in the information from Database B so that it contains all the current data found in the table that needs to be updated from Database A. Again I'm using a DataAdapter to fill this DataTable (a different one from Step 5, since they are both using different data sources).</p></li>
<li><p>Merge the DataTable that holds the data from Database A (or the .txt file, technically).</p></li>
<li><p>Update Database B's table with the changes.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I've written update, delete and insert commands manually for the DataAdapter that is repsonsible for talking to Database B. However, this logic is never used because the DataSet-From-Database-B.Merge(Dataset-From-TxtFile[tableName]) doesn't flip the HasChanges flag. This means the DataSet-From-Database-B.Update doesn't fire any of the commands.</p>

<p>So is there any way I can get the data from DataSet-From-TxtFile to merge and apply to Database B using the method I'm using? Am I missing a crucial step here?</p>

<p>I know I could always delete all the records from Database B's table and then just insert all the records from the text file (even if I had to loop through each record in the DataSet and apply row.SetAdded to ensure it triggers the HasChanges flag), but I'd rather have it apply ONLY the changes each time.</p>

<p>I'm using c# and the 2.0 Framework (which I realize means I can use DataTables and TableAdapters instead of DataSets and DataAdapters since I'm only dealing with a single table, but anyway).</p>

For using this interface in C#, I loaded rscproxy_1.3-1 package and then installed R_Scilab_DCOM3.0-1B5 on my machine. Also, I copied sciproxy.dll from Program Files\R(D)COM Server\Scilab to Program Files\R(D)COM Server\bin, as informed while installing the interface.</p>

<h2><strong>My Problem:</strong></h2>

<p>As a part of testing, I tried the code from blog post <a href=""http://vvella.blogspot.com/2010/08/integrate-c-net-and-r-taking-best-of.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://vvella.blogspot.com/2010/08/integrate-c-net-and-r-taking-best-of.html</a>.

On launched form, I clicked button “Start R” but it failed with error printed in text box as “Initializing R...Function call failed Code: -2147221485 Text: installation problem: unable to load connector” </p>

<h2>I tried this:</h2>

<p>I tried to troubleshoot it with the help of Index html page, and there under installation section, I found that there must be rproxy.dll under installed R/Bin folder. Also, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\R-core\R\InstallPath should point to installation folder.</p>

<p>Things lacking on my machine are</p>

<ul>
<li>the installed R/bin folder doesn’t
contain rproxy.dll. Where can I get
this dll? Or is it sciproxy.dll
instead?</li>
<li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\R-core\R\InstallPath
points to installation folder, but
there is no entry under
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can guess there is something fishy about installation, or registering COM server. But I am not successful in figuring it out.</p>

<pre><code>catch (Exception ex)
</code></pre>

<p>Is bad practise, however, I often use it in event handlers where an operation may for example go to network, allowing the possibility of many different types of failure. In this case, I catch all exceptions and display the error message to the user in a message box.</p>

<p>Is this considered bad practise? There's nothing more I can do with the exception: I don't want  it to halt the application, the user needs to know what happened, and I'm at the top level of my code. What else should I be doing?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>People are saying that I should look through the stack of calls and handle errors specifically, because for example a StackOverflow exception cannot be handled meaningfully. However, halting the process is the <b>worst</b> outcome, I want to prevent that at all costs. If I can't handle a StackOverflow, so be it - the outcome will be no worse than not catching exceptions at all, and in 99% of cases, informing the user is the least bad option as far as I'm concerned.</p>

<p>Also, despite my best efforts to work out all of the possible exceptions that can be thrown, in a large code-base it's likely that I would miss some. And for most of them the best defense is still to inform the user.</p>

<p>Because the DAL will eventually need to be consumed from perhaps more than one application, web.config does not seem like a good place to keep the connection strings and some of the other DAL-related settings.</p>

<p>To solve this, on some of our recent projects we introduced a third project just for settings. We put the setting in a system of .Setting files... With a simple wrapper, the ability to have different settings for various enviroments (Dev, QA, Staging, Production, etc) was easy to achieve.</p>

<p>The only problem there is that the settings project (including the .Settings class) compiles into an assembly, so you can't change it without doing a build/deployment, and some of our customers want to be able to configure their projects without Visual Studio.</p>

<p>So, is there a best practice for this? I have that sense that I'm reinventing the wheel.</p>

<p>Some solutions such as storing settings in a fixed directory on the server in, say, our own XML format occurred to us. But again, I would rather avoid having to re-create encryption for sensitive values and so on. And I would rather keep the solution self-contained if possible.</p>

(The WPF control and all of it's resource dictionaries are all defined in the same WPF Control Library DLL.)</p>

<p>As soon as that happens, I get a bunch of errors that look like this:</p>

<p>If the only way to accomplish this is to make changes on the WPF side, I can get those changes made (I'm not responsible for the WPF control library but the person that is also works for the same company so it's not a problem other than getting his time to make the changes.) but I'm hoping for something I can do on the WinForms side to get this working.</p>

<p>The WPF control library has a resource dictionary file named ""Default.xaml"" defined in the project with the following properties:</p>

<p>Build Action: Page
Copy to Output Directory: Do not copy
Custom Tool: MSBuild:Compile</p>

<p>The stand-alone WPF application has the following entry in it's App.xaml file:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;ResourceDictionary x:Uid=""ResourceDictionary_1""&gt;
        &lt;ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries&gt;
            &lt;ResourceDictionary x:Uid=""ResourceDictionary_2"" Source=""/SmartClient.Infrastructure;component/Themes\Default.xaml""/&gt;
        &lt;/ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries&gt;
    &lt;/ResourceDictionary&gt;

<p>It seems like the control library should already know how to get its resources. Using the Resources.MergedDictionaries.Add() seems like it should work, but where do I get the instance of the existing dictionary?</p>

It does this by first building the script, then executing it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>vsdbcmd.exe /a:Deploy /cs:""Data Source=(local);Integrated Security=True;Pooling=False"" /dsp:Sql /dd /model:""..\Database.dbschema"" /p:TargetDatabase=TargetDB /manifest:""..\Database.deploymanifest""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would expect that it can deploy the script to a different database server without problems. However, the complete path to the actual .mdf file is encoded in the script, along with some other references to the original databse. Either there isn't an option to control this, or I can't find it.</p>

<p>Is anyone using this? How do you deploy? Should I have used a different kind of database project (I remember having the choice way back when between ""Database project"" and ""Server project"", but I don't know whether that matters)?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I can override the .sqlcmdvars just fine, but this does not solve the problem. This is an extract from the generated .sql file using a command like above:</p>

<pre><code>GO
:setvar DatabaseName ""TargetDB""
:setvar DefaultDataPath ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\""
</code></pre>

<p>So there is the ""targetdb"" target database gets recorded correctly. But, a few lines further:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE DATABASE [$(DatabaseName)]
ON 
PRIMARY(NAME = [Original], FILENAME = 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\Original.mdf', SIZE = 3072 KB, MAXSIZE = UNLIMITED, FILEGROWTH = 1024 KB)
LOG ON (NAME = [Original_log], FILENAME = 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\Original_log.ldf', SIZE = 1024 KB, MAXSIZE = 2097152 MB, FILEGROWTH = 10 %)
</code></pre>

<p>where Original.mdf is the name of the original database (i.e. the db where we deploy during development, and that is set in the project properties of the database project). This is where the deployment fails, either because that exact path may be different on the target machine, or on my machine because that db already exists.</p>

<p>These values just seem hardcoded in the generated script.</p>

<p>Lately I've found it pretty easy to do some fancy things with UI design and with WPF specifically we're finding new ways to do layouts that are better looking and more functional for the user, but in contrast one of the business focused guys at our local .NET User Group wouldn't even think of using WPF until it had a datagrid that he could use to make Excel like input forms.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>So basically, have you rethought the design of your business apps as you move to Web/WPF/Silverlight designs, because for us at least - in winforms we kept things fairly functional and uniform, or are you trying to keep that ""known"" UI?</p></li>
<li><p>Would a dedicated design guy (for larger teams), or a dev with more design chops rank higher when looking at hiring these days?

He had placed a try/catch block in the main working function for catching all unhadled exceptions that bubbled up to this level, logging them together with stack trace info etc:</p>

<pre><code>try
{
    // do main work
}
catch(Exception ex)
{
    // log exception info
}
</code></pre>

<p>While this makes the program very stable (as in 'unlikely to crash'), I hate it because when I am testing my code, I do not see the exceptions caused by it. Of course I can look at the exception log and see if there are new entries, but I very much prefer the direct feedback of getting the exception the moment it is thrown (with the cursor on the right line in the code, please).</p>

<p>I removed this top level try/catch at least while i was still coding and testing. But now my task is finished and I have to decide wether to put it back in for the release, or not.
I think that I should do it, because it makes the service more stable, and the whole point of it is that it runs in the background without needing any supervision. On the other hand I have read that one should only call specific exceptions (as in <code>IoException</code>), not generically <code>Exception</code>.</p>

<p>What is your advice on this issue?</p>

<p>This works fine and the process starts as expected. However, when this process tries to launch other processes itself, currently just using CreateProcess() these start then die straight away - they are executables that require desktop access.</p>

<p>After reading up on Microsoft's article on CreateProcess() - <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682425(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682425(VS.85).aspx</a></p>

<p>I think can see why this is happening and it makes sense to an extent. CreateProcess() knows the calling process is impersonating a user so it uses it's parent process, which in this case is the Local System account. But of course anything run in the local system account doesn't have the access we need, so the launched process dies.</p>

<p>Oddly when I was previously using LogonUser() and CreateProcessAsUser() to launch the initial executable within the service, it worked fine. But I had to change this to CreateProcessWithLogonW() due to problems with not having the correct privileges.</p>

<p>Does anybody know of a solution to this? I've seen talk about this elsewhere on the web but not with any definite solution. It seems like I possibly need the token of the user i'm logging on with in CreateProcessWithLogonW() with so I can use it to launch the other processes later? But I have no way of getting hold of this token, can this be retreived for the current user in any way?</p>

<p>Some background:
I'm writing a desktop application in Java.  It's an audio application that has a number of views and a central model called a Library with playlists, effects lists and a folder structure to organize them.  In this application I'd like to have menus, context-menus and drag and drop support for various user actions.  I've been struggling with how to achieve this using MVC.</p>

<p>I started with all the logic/controllers in the main class but have started to separate them out into their own classes.  Now I need to start using listeners and observers to handle messages between the views and the controller.  This led to me creating a number of interfaces and looping through my listeners in several places to fire off various messages.  But that loop code keeps getting repeated (not DRY), so I'm assuming that now I should create different types of Event classes, create those events in my views and use a single method within the view to fire it off to the various listeners.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Arguabley it shouldn't matter much but I'm using SWT, not Swing.</p>

Most of the work is done, but we haven't figured out how/where to store the key. I've done some light searching and reading, and it seems like a hardware solution might be the most secure. Does anyone have any recommendations on a key storage solution or method?</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks for your replies, everyone.</p>

<p>spoulson, the issue is actually both the ""scopes"" that you mentioned. I suppose I should have been clearer.</p>

<p>The data itself, as well as the logic that encrypts it and decrypts it is abstracted away into an ASP.NET profile provider. This profile provider allows both encrypted profile properties as well as plain text ones. The encrypted property values are stored in exactly the same way the plain text ones are - with the obvious exception that they've been encrypted.</p>

<p>That said, the key will need to be able to be summoned for one of three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>The authorized web application, running on an authorized server, needs to encrypt data.</li>
<li>Same as #1, but for decrypting the data.</li>
<li>Authorized members of our business team need to view the encrypted data.</li>
</ol>

<p>The way I'm imagining it is that nobody would ever actually know the key - there would be a piece of software controlling the actual encrypting and decrypting of data. That said, the key still needs to come from <em>somewhere</em>.</p>

<p>Full disclosure - if you couldn't already tell, I've never done anything like this before, so if I'm completely off base in my perception of how this should work, by all means, let me know.</p>

<p><strong>THE CIRCUMSTANCES</strong></p>

<p>I have a table which users a string as a primary key, this table has various many to one and many to many relationships all off this primary key.</p>

<p>When searching for multiple items from the table all relationships were brought back. However whenever I tried to get the object by the primary key (string) it was not bringing back any relationships, they were always set to 0. </p>

<p><strong>THE PARTIAL SOLUTION</strong></p>

<p>So I looked into my logs to see what the SQL was doing and that was returning the correct results. So I tried various things in all sorts of random ways and eventually worked out it was. The case of the string being passed into the get method was not EXACTLY the same case as it was in the database, so when it tried to match up the relationship items with the main entity it was finding nothing <strong>(Or at least NHIbernate wasn't because as I stated above the SQL was actually returning the correct results)</strong></p>

<p><strong>THE REAL SOLUTION</strong></p>

<p>Has anyone else come across this? If so how do you tell NHibernate to ignore case when matching SQL results to the entity? It is silly because it worked perfectly well before now all of a sudden it has started to pay attention to the case of the string.</p>

I want the encrypted data file to be self-contained and portable, so the authentication has to be embedded in the file (or so I assume).</p>

<p>I have a strategy that appears workable and seems logical based on what I know (which is probably just enough to be dangerous), but I have no idea if it's actually a good design or not.  So tell me: is this crazy?  Is there a better/best way to do it?</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 1: User enters plain-text password, e.g. ""MyDifficultPassword""  </li>
<li>Step 2: App hashes the user-password and uses that value as the symmetric key to encrypt/decrypt the data file.  e.g. ""MyDifficultPassword"" --> ""HashedUserPwdAndKey"".  </li>
<li>Step 3: App hashes the hashed value from step 2 and saves the new value in the data file header (i.e. the unencrypted part of the data file) and uses that value to validate the user's password.  e.g. ""HashedUserPwdAndKey"" --> ""HashedValueForAuthentication""</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically I'm extrapolating from the common way to implement web-site passwords (when you're not using OpenID, that is), which is to store the (salted) hash of the user's password in your DB and never save the actual password.  But since I use the hashed user password for the symmetric encryption key, I can't use the same value for authentication.  So I hash it again, basically treating it just like another password, and save the doubly-hashed value in the data file.  That way, I can take the file to another PC and decrypt it by simply entering my password.</p>

<p>So is this design reasonably secure, or hopelessly naive, or somewhere in between?  Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT: clarification and follow-up question re: Salt.<br>
I thought the salt had to be kept secret to be useful, but your answers and links imply this is not the case.  For example, <a href=""ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-5v2/pkcs5v2-0.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">this spec</a> linked by erickson (below) says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus, password-based key derivation as defined here is a function of a password, a salt, and an iteration count, where the latter two quantities need not be kept secret.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this mean that I could store the salt value in the same place/file as the hashed key and still be more secure than if I used no salt at all when hashing?  How does that work?</p>

<p>A little more context: the encrypted file isn't meant to be shared with or decrypted by others, it's really single-user data.  But I'd like to deploy it in a shared environment on computers I don't fully control (e.g. at work) and be able to migrate/move the data by simply copying the file (so I can use it at home, on different workstations, etc.).</p>

<p>Java, like many other languages, has interface inheritance and implementation inheritance. E.g. a Java class can inherit from another one and every method that has an implementation there (assuming the parent is not abstract) is inherited, too. That means the interface is inherited and the implementation for this method as well. I can overwrite it, but I don't have to. If I don't overwrite it, I have inherited the implementation.</p>

<p>However, my class can also ""inherit"" (not in Java terms) just an interface, without implementation. Actually interfaces are really named that way in Java, they provide interface inheritance, but without inheriting any implementation, since all methods of an interface have no implementation.</p>

<p>Now there was this <a href=""http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-2003/jw-0801-toolbox.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">article, saying it's better to inherit interfaces than implementations</a>, you may like to read it (at least the first half of the first page), it's pretty interesting. It avoids issues like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_base_class"" rel=""noreferrer"">fragile base class problem</a>. So far this makes all a lot of sense and many other things said in the article make a lot of sense to me.</p>

<p>What bugs me about this, is that implementation inheritance means <strong>code reuse</strong>, one of the most important properties of OO languages. Now if Java had no classes (like James Gosling, the godfather of Java has wished according to this article), it solves all problems of implementation inheritance, but how would you make code reuse possible then?</p>

<p>E.g. if I have a class Car and Car has a method move(), which makes the Car move. Now I can sub-class Car for different type of cars, that are all cars, but are all specialized versions of Car. Some may move in a different way, these need to overwrite move() anyway, but most would simply keep the inherited move, as they move alike just like the abstract parent Car. Now assume for a second that there are only interfaces in Java, only interfaces may inherit from each other, a class may implement interfaces, but all classes are always final, so no class can inherit from any other class.</p>

<p>How would you avoid that when you have an Interface Car and hundred Car classes, that you need to implement an identical move() method for each of them? What concepts for code reuse other than implementation inheritance exist in the the OO world?</p>

<p>Some languages have Mixins. Are Mixins the answer to my question? I read about them, but I cannot really imagine how Mixins would work in a Java world and if they can really solve the problem here.</p>

<p>Another idea was that there is a class that only implements the Car interface, let's call it AbstractCar, and implements the move() method. Now other cars implement the Car interface as well, internally they create an instance of AbstractCar and they implement their own move() method by calling move() on their internal abstract Car. But wouldn't this be wasting resources for nothing (a method calling just another method - okay, JIT could inline the code, but still) and using extra memory for keeping internal objects, you wouldn't even need with implementation inheritance? (after all every object needs more memory than just the sum of the encapsulated data) Also isn't it awkward for a programmer to write dummy methods like</p>

<pre><code>public void move() {
    abstractCarObject.move();
}
</code></pre>

<p>?</p>

<p>Anyone can imagine a better idea how to avoid implementation inheritance and still be able to re-use code in an easy fashion?</p>

<p>Sure - the preprocessor and compiler need to see a flat file representation of the file, but that's easily created.</p>

<p>It seems to me that some form of XML or binary data could represent lots of ideas that are very difficult to track, otherwise.</p>

<p>For instance, you could embed UML diagrams right into your code.  They could be generated semi-automatically, and annotated by the developers to highlight important aspects of the design.  Interaction diagrams in particular.  Heck, embedding any user drawing might make things more clear.</p>

<p>Another idea is to embed comments from code reviews right into the code.</p>

<p>There could be all sorts of aids to make merging multiple branches easier.</p>

<p>Something I'm passionate about is not just tracking code coverage, but also looking at the parts of code covered by an automated test.  The hard part is keeping track of that code, even as the source is modified.  For instance, moving a function from one file to another, etc.  This can be done with GUIDs, but they're rather intrusive to embed right in the text file.  In a rich file format, they could be automatic and unobtrusive.</p>

<p>So why are there no IDEs (to my knowledge, anyway) which allow you to work with code in this way?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> On October 7th, 2009.</p>

<p>Most of you got very hung up on the word ""binary"" in my question.  I retract it.  Picture XML, very minimally marking up your code.  The instant before you hand it to your normal preprocessor or compiler, you strip out all of the XML markup, and pass on just the source code.  In this form, you could still do all of the normal things to the file: diff, merge, edit, work with in a simple and minimal editor, feed them into thousands of tools.  Yes, the diff, merge, and edit, directly with the minimal XML markup, does get a tad more complicated.  But I think the value could be enormous.</p>

<p>If an IDE existed which respected all of the XML, you could add so much more than what we can do today.</p>

<p>For instance, your DOxygen comments could actually <em>look</em> like the final DOxygen output.</p>

<p>When someone wanted to do a code review, like Code Collaborator, they could mark up the source code, in place.</p>

<p>The XML could even be hidden behind comments.</p>

<pre><code>// &lt;comment author=""mcruikshank"" date=""2009-10-07""&gt;
// Please refactor to Delegate.
// &lt;/comment&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then if you want to use vi or emacs, you can just skip over the comments.</p>

<p>If I want to use a state-of-the-art editor, I can see that in about a dozen different helpful ways.</p>

<p>So, that's my rough idea.  It's not ""building blocks"" of pictures that you drag on the screen...  I'm not that nuts.  :)</p>

"406915","1","","","2009-01-02 14:30:39","","4","7178","<p>Andreas Huber's answer to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/405600/detecting-that-a-threadpool-workitem-has-completed-waiting-for-completion"">this question</a> gave me an idea to implement <code>Concurrent&lt;T&gt;</code> with async delegates instead of the ThreadPool. However, I am finding it harder to understand what's going on when an <code>AsyncCallback</code> is passed to <code>BeginInvoke</code>, especially when several threads have access to <code>IAsyncResult</code>. Unfortunately, this case doesn't seem to be covered at MSDN or anywhere I could find. Moreover, all articles I could find were either written before closures and generics were available or just seem that way. There are several questions (and the answers which I hope are true, but I am ready to be disappointed):</p>

<p>1) Would using a closure as an AsyncCallback make any difference?<br>
(Hopefully not)<br>
2) If a thread waits on the <code>AsyncWaitHandle</code>, will it be signaled<br>
a) before the callback starts or 
b) after it finishes?<br>
(Hopefully b)<br>
3) While the callback is running, what will <code>IsCompleted</code> return? Possibilities I can see:<br>
a) <code>true</code>;
b) <code>false</code>;
c) <code>false</code> before the callback calls EndInvoke, <code>true</code> after.<br>
(Hopefully b or c)<br>
4) Will <code>DisposedObjectException</code> be thrown if some thread waits on the <code>AsyncWaitHandle</code> after <code>EndInvoke</code> is called?<br>
(Hopefully not, but I expect yes).</p>

<p>Provided the answers are as I hope, this seems like it should work:</p>

<pre><code>public class Concurrent&lt;T&gt; { 
    private IAsyncResult _asyncResult;
    private T _result;

    public Concurrent(Func&lt;T&gt; f) { // Assume f doesn't throw exceptions
        _asyncResult = f.BeginInvoke(
                           asyncResult =&gt; {
                               // Assume assignment of T is atomic
                               _result = f.EndInvoke(asyncResult); 
                           }, null);
    }

    public T Result {
        get {
            if (!_asyncResult.IsCompleted)
                // Is there a race condition here?
                _asyncResult.AsyncWaitHandle.WaitOne();
            return _result;  // Assume reading of T is atomic
        }
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>If the answers to the questions 1-3 are the ones I hope for, there should be no raace condition here, as far as I can see.</p>

    oObject.GetByKey(KeyValue)

<p>It gives the error when SetValue method is called. Instead, if I use this like following it works fine:</p>

<pre><code>oObject.CreditLimit = 129
oObject.Update
</code></pre>

<p>Where CreditLimit is a property of the given class, and update is a method which I have to call, after the value is set, so that the value in underlying database is updated.</p>

<p>Similarly GetByKey is used to retrieve the value of the object from the underlying database, where the value of the primary key field has to be passed.</p>

<p>Since there are multiple classes and each class has lots of different properties, therefore calling them dynamically will help a lot.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input style=""width: auto"" ...&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which worked just fine.  Now I'm going back to clean up the temporary fixes and I'm moving all the styles out of style attributes into external stylesheets.  When I move this particular ""width: auto"" style into the stylesheet it still looks fine in Firefox, but in IE it ignores it and defaults to ""width: 100%"" again which blows out elements next to it again.</p>

<p>The IE web developer tool bar doesn't tell me where styles are coming from, so it's hard to diagnose what is going on.  My best guess is that there is something else taking precedence in IE, but I don't know what it could be.</p>

<p>Edit: I swear I tried right-click in the IE developer bar but I guess not - when I do ""trace style"" on the ""width: 100%"" in IE I get a popup that just says ""1. No match"", however in Firefox it showed that the 100% was bleeding through from a selector on an above element that was something like ""#outer foo bar INPUT"" which covered this INPUT as well.  I mistakenly assumed that an ""#id"" directly on the INPUT element would have a higher specificity than ""#id foo bar INPUT"" but I guess the browsers disagree about this.

<p>Assume the following scenario: one central data structure (very large, so I don't really want to make it immutable and copy it around whenever a change occurs. I even don't want to keep multiple copies in memory), multiple reader threads that access that data structure read-only and one writer thread which keeps the data structure up to date in the background.</p>

<p>I currently synchronize all accesses to the data structure, which works just fine (no synchronization effects, no deadlocks). What I don't like about this approach is that most of the time I have a lot of reader threads active and the writer thread only active every now and then. Now it is completely unnecessary for the reader threads to wait for other reader threads to finish. They could easily access the data structure in parallel as long as the writer thread is not currently writing.</p>

<p>Is there a nice and elegant way to solve this kind of scenario?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thank you very much for the answers and links! Let me add just another short and related question: if the code executed within the reader's critical sections takes only a very short time (like just a hash table lookup), is it even worth considering implementing one of the techniques you describe or is the serialization effect of the locks not so bad in this case? Scalability and performance are very important. What do you think?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> I just looked into one implementation of a single writer / mulitple readers - lock and this implementation uses a monitor to synchronize some code in the WaitToRead method. Doesn't this cause the same serialization effect that I wanted to avoid in the first place? (Still assuming that the code to be synchronized is short and fast)</p>

<p>Everything works fine in MyWorkingProject where I only have a file reference to CommonUtils.dll - log4net.dll shows up in the output directory (as it is a dependency of CommonUtils.dll but not referenced from MyWorkingProject).
However if I create a new project to add some unittests: MyWorkingProjectTest and project reference MyWorkingProject and then file reference CommonUtils.dll again here (I want to use some of the CommonUtils) then upon building log4net.dll which is a dependency in both the project reference and in the file reference as well does not get copied to the output directory.</p>

<p>Can anyone clarify what is happening here? Does the compiler not know which of the log4net.dll files it should grab? Is there something I am doing wrong here? Should I do this in some other way for the log4net.dll to get copied explicitly? 
Does it make any sense that I have to explicitly reference log4net does it?</p>

<p>one example is:

I have the cultureInfo objects, the problem is that when I do a DateTime.ToString(""ES-es""), I get too much info - I need only month+day, but with the default ToString, I get year+month+day</p>

<p>Edit again:
I see how I can change the ShortDate pattern for each CultureInfo object I use. However, I also need the default ShortDate pattern in some situations, so changing that would, unfortunately, leave me with another, equivalent problem.</p>

<p>One area that particularly interests me is the User Interface; specifically how to build this and connect it to my OO ""model"".</p>

<p>I've been doing some reading on this area. One of my favourites is this:
<a href=""http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-07-1999/jw-07-toolbox.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Building user interfaces for object-oriented systems</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""All objects must provide their own UI""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thinking about <em>my</em> problem, I can see this working well. I build my ""user"" object to represent someone who has logged into my website, for example. One of my methods is then ""display_yourself"" or similar. I can use this throughout my code. Perhaps to start with this will just be their name. Later, if I need to adjust to show their name+small avatar, I can just update this one method and hey-presto, my app is updated. Or if I need to make their name a link to their profile, hey-presto I can update again easily from one place.</p>

<p>In terms of an OO system; I think this approach works well. Looking on other StackOverflow threads, I found this under ""Separation of Concerns"":
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/98734/separation-of-concerns"">Soc</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""In computer science, separation of
  concerns (SoC) is the process of
  breaking a computer program into
  distinct features that overlap in
  functionality as little as possible. A
  concern is any piece of interest or
  focus in a program. Typically,
  concerns are synonymous with features
  or behaviors. Progress towards SoC is
  traditionally achieved through
  modularity and encapsulation, with the
  help of information hiding.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To my mind I have achieved this. My user object hides all it's information. I don't have any places in my code where I say $user->get_user_name() before I display it.</p>

<p>However, this seems to go against what other people seem to think of as ""best practice"". </p>

<p>To quote the ""selected"" (green one) answer from the same question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The separation of concerns is keeping
  the code for each of these concerns
  separate. Changing the interface
  should not require changing the
  business logic code, and vice versa.
  Model-View-Controller (MVC) design
  pattern is an excellent example of
  separating these concerns for better
  software maintainability.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does this make for better software maintainability? Surely with MVC, my View has to know an awful lot about the Model? Read the JavaWorld article for a detailed discussion on this point:
<a href=""http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-07-1999/jw-07-toolbox.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Building user interfaces for object-oriented systems</a> </p>

<p>Anyway... getting to the actual point, finally!</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Can anyone recommend any books that discuss this in detail? I don't want an MVC book; I'm not sold on MVC. I want a book that discusses OO / UI, the potential issues, potential solutuions etc.. (maybe including MVC)
Arthur Riel's <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/020163385X"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Object-Oriented Design Heuristics</a></p>

<p>touches on it (and is an excellent book as well!), but I want something that goes into more detail.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Can anyone put forward an argument that is as well-explained as Allen Holub's JavaWorld article that explains why MVC is a good idea? </p>

<p>Many thanks for anyone who can help me reach a conclusion on this.</p>

The reason is so that std.string will work with compile time function evaluation.  For those of you unfamiliar w/ D, functions can be evaluated at compile time if certain restrictions are met.

Like many web services I've encountered, this one requests limiting the rate of requests. I would like to provide an optional parameter, <code>limit</code>, to the class instantiation that, if provided, will hold outgoing requests until the number of seconds specified passes.</p>

<p>I understand that the general scenario is the following: an instance of the class makes a request via a method. When it does, the method emits some signal that sets a lock variable somewhere, and begins a countdown timer for the number of seconds in <code>limit</code>. (In all likelihood, the lock is the countdown timer itself.) If another request is made within this time frame, it must be queued until the countdown timer reaches zero and the lock is disengaged; at this point, the oldest request on the queue is sent, and the countdown timer is reset and the lock is re-engaged.</p>

<p>Is this a case for threading? Is there another approach I'm not seeing?</p>

<p>Should the countdown timer and lock be instance variables, or should they belong to the class, such that all instances of the class hold requests?</p>

<p>Also, is this generally a bad idea to provide rate-limiting functionality within a library? I reason since, by default, the countdown is zero seconds, the library still allows developers to use the library and provide their own rate-limiting schemes. Given any developers using the service will need to rate-limit requests anyway, however, I figure that it would be a convenience for the library to provide a means of rate-limiting.</p>

<p>Regardless of placing a rate-limiting scheme in the library or not, I'll want to write an application using the library, so suggested techniques will come in handy.</p>

I've been using <code>python-mode.el</code> for something like ten years, so perhaps I'm a little set in my ways.  I'd be interested in hearing from anyone who's carefully evaluated the two modes, in particular of the pros and cons they perceive of each and how their work generally interacts with the features specific to <code>python.el</code>.</p>

<p>The two major issues for me with <code>python.el</code> were </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Each buffer visiting a python file gets its own inferior interactive python shell.  I am used to doing development in one interactive shell and sharing data between python files.  (Might seem like bad practice from a software-engineering perspective, but I'm usually working with huge datasets which take a while to load into memory.)</p></li>
<li><p>The skeleton-mode support in python.el, which seemed absolutely gratuitous (python's syntax makes such automation unnecessary) and badly designed (for instance, it has no knowledge of ""<code>for</code>"" loop generator expressions or ""<code>&lt;expr 1&gt; if &lt;cond&gt; else &lt;expr 2&gt;</code>"" expressions, so you have to go back and remove the colons it helpfully inserts after insisting that you enter the expression clauses in the minibuffer.)  I couldn't figure out how to turn it off.  There was a <code>python.el</code> variable which claimed to control this, but it didn't seem to work.  It could be that the version of <code>python.el</code> I was using was broken (it came from the debian emacs-snapshot package) so if anyone knows of an up-to-date version of it, I'd like to hear about it.  (I had the same problem with the version in CVS emacs as of approximately two weeks ago.)</p></li>

<p>Take for instance this array:</p>

<pre><code>Int32[] x = new Int32[10];
</code></pre>

<p>I understand that the bulk of the array is like this:</p>

<pre><code>0000111122223333444455556666777788889999
</code></pre>

<p>Where each character is one byte, and the digits corresponds to indices into the array.</p>

<p>Additionally, I know that there is a type reference, and a syncblock-index for all objects, so the above can be adjusted to this:</p>

<pre><code>ttttssss0000111122223333444455556666777788889999
        ^
        +- object reference points here
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, the length of the array needs to be stored, so perhaps this is more correct:</p>

<pre><code>ttttssssllll0000111122223333444455556666777788889999
        ^
        +- object reference points here
</code></pre>

<p>Is this complete? Are there more data in an array?</p>

<p>The reason I'm asking is that we're trying to estimate how much memory a couple of different in-memory representations of a rather large data corpus will take and the size of the arrays varies quite a bit, so the overhead might have a large impact in one solution, but perhaps not so much in the other.</p>

<p>So basically, for an array, how much overhead is there, that is basically my question.</p>

<p>And before the <em>arrays are bad</em> squad wakes up, this part of the solution is a static build-once-reference-often type of thing so using growable lists is not necessary here.</p>

<p>Before my arrival on my current team, query testing was done by the testers manually crafting queries that would theoretically return a result set that the stored procedure should return based on various relevancy rules, sorting, what have you.</p>

<p>This had the side effect of bugs being filed against the tester's query more often than against the actual query in question.</p>

<p>I proposed actually working with a known result set that you could just infer how it should return since you control the data present -- previously, data was pulled from production, sanitized, and then populated in our test databases.</p>

<p>People were still insistent on creating their own queries to test what the developers have created.  I suspect that many still are.  I have it in my mind that this isn't ideal at all, and just increases our testing footprint needlessly.</p>

<ul>
<li>libNxCharacter.so.1</li>
<li>libNxCooking.so.1</li>
<li>libPhysXCore.so.1</li>

<p>And the following search paths just in case (-L):</p>

<ul>
<li>/usr/lib/PhysX/v2.8.1</li>
<li>/usr/lib</li>

<p>In these areas, the background is just the plain gray you get when drawing an empty canvas. </p>

<p>I've tried forcing the Labels to inherit the background like so:</p>

<pre><code>label.setBackgroundMode(SWT.INHERIT_DEFAULT) //SWT.INHERIT_FORCE Doesn't work either
</code></pre>

<p>But this leaves me with the same default gray and no gradient behind the components on top of the Composite. </p>

<p>Any suggestions for getting the gradient to be the background of each element?</p>

<p>I wouldn't be opposed to drawing the Gradient onto a gc with an image supplied and then setting the background to that Image. However that method just hasn't been working at all, composite or any of its elements. </p>

<p>Also it's not possible for me to set the gradient individually to my knowledge. We want the whole composite to be one uniform flowing gradient. </p>

These controls are added to the page by the code-behind class and they have some event-handlers added to them. Upon the PostBacks these event-handlers have a lot to do with what controls are then shown on the page. To cut the story short, this doesn't work for me and I don't seem to be able to figure this out.</p>

<p>So, as my project is quite involved, I decided to create a short example that doesn't work either but if you can tweak it so that it works, that would be great and I would then be able to apply your solution to my original problem.</p>

<p>The following example should dynamically create three buttons on a panel. When one of the buttons is pressed all of the buttons should be dynamically re-created except for the button that was pressed. In other words, just hide the button that the user presses and show the other two.</p>

<p>For your solution to be helpful you can't statically create the buttons and then use the Visible property (or drastically change the example in other ways) - you have to re-create all the button controls dynamically upon every PostBack (not necessarily in the event-handler though). This is not a trick-question - I really don't know how to do this. Thank you very much for your effort. Here is my short example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;form id=""form1"" runat=""server""&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;

    &lt;/form&gt;

<p>Last year, I did an internship in a physics research group at a university. In this group, we mostly used <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW"" rel=""noreferrer"">LabVIEW</a> to write programs for controlling our setups, doing data acquisition and analyzing our data. For the first two purposes, that works quite OK, but for data analysis, it's a real pain. On top of that, everyone was mostly self-taught, so code that was written was generally quite a mess (no wonder that every PhD quickly decided to rewrite everything from scratch). Version control was unknown, and impossible to set up because of strict software and network regulations from the IT department.</p>

<p>Now, things actually worked out surprisingly OK, but how do people in the natural sciences do their software development?</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<p>Some concrete questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What languages/environments have you used for developing scientific software, especially data analysis? What libraries? (for example, what do you use for plotting?)</li>
<li>Was there any training for people without any significant background in programming?</li>
<li>Did you have anything like version control, and bug tracking?</li>
<li>How would you go about trying to create a decent environment for programming, without getting too much in the way of the individual scientists (especially physicists are stubborn people!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary of answers thus far</h3>

<p>The answers (or my interpretation of them) thus far: (2008-10-11)</p>

<ul>
<li>Languages/packages that seem to be the most widely used:

<ul>
<li>LabVIEW</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Python</a>

<ul>
<li>with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SciPy"" rel=""noreferrer"">SciPy</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy"" rel=""noreferrer"">NumPy</a>, <a href=""http://www.scipy.org/PyLab"" rel=""noreferrer"">PyLab</a>, etc. (See also Brandon's reply for downloads and links)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>C/C++</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB"" rel=""noreferrer"">MATLAB</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Version control is used by nearly all respondents; bug tracking and other processes are much less common.</li>
<li>The Software Carpentry course is a good way to teach programming and development techniques to scientists.</li>
<li>How to improve things?

<ul>
<li>Don't force people to follow strict protocols.</li>
<li>Set up an environment yourself, and show the benefits to others. Help them to start working with version control, bug tracking, etc. themselves.</li>
<li>Reviewing other people's code can help, but be aware that not everyone may appreciate that.</li>

Something like:</p>

<pre><code>string f(){
   ostringstream o;
   o &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; ""b"" &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; d;
   return o.str()
}

<p>Essentially, <code>FORMAT(a &lt;&lt; ""b"" &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; d) == f()</code>.</p>

<p>First, I tried:</p>

<pre><code>1: #define FORMAT(items)                                                   \
   ((std::ostringstream&amp;)(std::ostringstream() &lt;&lt; items)).str()
</code></pre>

<p>If the very first item is a C string (<code>const char *</code>), it will print the address of the string in hex, and the next items will print fine. If the very first item is an <code>std::string</code>, it will fail to compile (no matching operator <code>&lt;&lt;</code>).</p>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>2: #define FORMAT(items)                                                   \
   ((std::ostringstream&amp;)(std::ostringstream() &lt;&lt; 0 &lt;&lt; '\b' &lt;&lt; items)).str()
</code></pre>

<p>gives what seems like the right output, but the <code>0</code> and <code>\b</code> are present in the string of course.</p>

<p>The following seems to work, but compiles with warnings (taking address of temporary):</p>

<pre><code>3: #define FORMAT(items)                                                   \
   ((std::ostringstream&amp;)(*((std::ostream*)(&amp;std::ostringstream())) &lt;&lt; items)).str()

<p>Does anyone know why 1 prints the address of the c-string and fails to compile with the <code>std::string</code>? Aren't 1 and 3 essentially the same?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Doing some research I found out that wsHttpBinding uses WS-Addressing standards, and reading about this standard I learned that the SOAP header is enhanced to include tags like ‘MessageID’, ‘ReplyTo’, ‘Action’ and ‘To’.</p>

<p>So I’m guessing that, because the client application endpoint specifies the Firewall IP address and Port, and the service replies with its internal network address which is different from the Firewall’s IP, then WS-Addressing fires the above message. Which I think it’s a very good security measure, but it’s not quite useful in my scenario.</p>

<p>Quoting the WS-Addressing standard submission (<a href=""http://www.w3.org/Submission/ws-addressing/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.w3.org/Submission/ws-addressing/</a>) </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Due to the range of network technologies currently in wide-spread use
  (e.g., NAT, DHCP, firewalls), many deployments cannot assign a
  meaningful global URI to a given endpoint. To allow these ‘anonymous’
  endpoints to initiate message exchange patterns and receive replies,
  WS-Addressing defines the following well-known URI for use by
  endpoints that cannot have a stable, resolvable URI.

</blockquote>

<p><strong>HOW can I configure my wsHttpBinding Endpoint to address my Firewall’s IP and to ignore or bypass the address specified in the ‘To’ WS-Addressing tag in the SOAP message header? Or do I have to change something in my service endpoint configuration?</strong></p>

I can think of two negative side-effects:<br>
1) superclass logs with the subclass's logger<br>
2) object cannot be serialized (unless marked transient)  </p>

<p>But if serializing is not necessary and logging with subclass name is not a problem, is there anything else why it should be avoided? I think it reduces boilerplate code and avoids copy-paste errors while copying logger variable definition from one class to another.

The request signature is stored in a HTTP header and the request is simply sent over HTTP (not HTTPS).  </p>

<p>This key must stay secret at all times yet needs to be used by the iPhone app.</p>

<p>So, how would you securely store this key given that you've always been told to never store anything sensitive on the client side?</p>

<p>The average user (99% of users) will happily just use the application.  There will be somebody (an enemy?) who wants that secret client key so as to do the service or client key owner harm by way of impersonation.  Such a person might jailbreak their phone, get access to the binary, run 'strings' or a hex editor and poke around.  Thus, just storing the key in the source code is a terrible idea. </p>

<p>Another idea is storing the key in code not a string literal but in a NSMutableArray that's created from byte literals.  </p>

<p>One can use the Keychain but since an iPhone app never has to supply a password to store things in the Keychain, I'm wary that someone with access to the app's sandbox can and will be able to simply look at or trivially decode items therein.  </p>

<p>EDIT - so I read this about the Keychain: ""In iPhone OS, an application always has access to its own keychain items and does not have access to any other application’s items. The system generates its own password for the keychain, and stores the key on the device in such a way that it is not accessible to any application.""</p>

<p>So perhaps this is the best place to store the key.... If so, how do I ship with the key pre-entered into the app's keychain?  Is that possible?  Else, how could you add the key on first launch without the key being in the source code?  Hmm..</p>

After about 10 hours of work, the server goes into 100% CPU panic attacks and just stalls. During this time you cannot run any new programs, so you can't even <code>kill -quit</code> to get a stack trace. These high 100% SYS CPU loads last 10-20 seconds and repeat every few minutes.</p>

<p>We have been working on for quite a while. We suspect it has something to do with the GC, but cannot confirm it with a smaller program. We are running on i386 32bit, RHEL5 and Java 1.5.0_10 using <code>-client</code> and <code>ParNew GC</code>.</p>

<p>Here's what we have tried so far:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We limited the CPU affinity so we can actually use the server when the high load hits. With <code>strace</code> we see an endless loop of <code>SIGSEGV</code> and then the sig return. </p></li>
<li><p>We tried to reproduce this with a Java program. It's true that SYS CPU% climbs high with <code>WeakHashMap</code> or when accessing null pointers. Problem was that <code>fillStackTrace</code> took a lot of user CPU% and that's why we never reached 100% SYS CPU.</p></li>
<li><p>We know that after 10 hours of stress, GC goes crazy and full GC sometimes takes 5 seconds. So we assume it has something to do with memory.</p></li>
<li><p><code>jstack</code> during that period showed all threads as blocked. <code>pstack</code> during that time, showed MarkSweep stack trace occasionally, so we can't be sure about this as well. Sending <code>SIGQUIT</code> yielded nothing: Java dumped the stack trace AFTER the SYS% load period was over.</p></li>

<p>If my application uses Quicktime, I'd like to install the necessary libraries with it's installer, thus not requiring user to install Quicktime separately. What I'm looking for is some sort of ""quicktime redistributable"".</p>

<p>As of now (quicktime 7.x), I can't find a way to do that. I could bundle whole quicktime installer (about 20 MiB), and launch it with MSI's silent/unattended flag. However, that way it has several side effects:</p>

<ol>
<li>creates Quicktime player shortcut on desktop and in quick launch bar</li>
<li>hijacks file associations, (e.g. .mov becomes associated with Quicktime Player, even if it was associated with something else before)</li>

<li>installs Quicktime Player, which I don't need in fact.</li>

<p>We have an in house document storage system that was implemented long ago.  For whatever reason, using the database as the storage mechanism for the documents was chosen.</p>

<p><strong>My question is this:</strong>  </p>

<p>What is the best practice for storing documents?  What are the alternatives? What are the pros and cons?  <em>Answers do not have to be technology or platform specific, it is more of a general best practice question.</em></p>

<p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong></p>

<p>Databases are not meant for document storage.  File Systems or 3rd party Document Management systems may be of better use.  Document Storage in Databases is expensive.  Operations are slow.  Are these logic assumptions?  Perhaps this is best, but in my mind, we have better alternatives.  Could oracle BFILE's (links to document on NAS or SAN) be better than BLOB / CLOB?</p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Documents are various types (pdf, word, xml)</li>
<li>The Middle Tier code is written in .net 2.0 / c#</li>
<li>Documents are stored in a Oracle 10g database in BLOB with compression (NAS Storage)</li>
<li>File sizes rage </li>
<li>The number of document is growing drastically and has no signs of slowing down</li>
<li>Inserts is typically is in the hunderds per hour during peak</li>
<li>Retreival is typically in the thousands per hour during peak</li>
<li>NAS storage and SAN storage is available</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE (from questions below):</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>my background is development</li>
<li>there is associated meta-data about the files stored next to file in the database</li>

We know that a ref parameter in C# passes a <em>reference</em> to a variable, allowing the external variable itself to be changed within a called method.  But is the reference handled much like a C pointer (reading the current contents of the original variable with every access to that parameter and changing the original variable with every modification to the parameter), or can the called method rely on a consistent reference for the duration of the call?  The former brings up some thread safety issues.  In particular:</p>

<p>I've written a static method in C# which passes an object by reference:</p>

<pre><code>public static void Register(ref Definition newDefinition) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>The caller provides a completed but not-yet-registered <code>Definition</code> object, and after some consistency checking we ""register"" the definition they provided.  However, if there is already a definition with the same key, it can't register the new one and instead their reference is updated to the ""official"" <code>Definition</code> for that key.</p>

<p>We want this to be rigorously thread-safe, but a pathological scenario comes to mind.  Suppose the client (using our library) shares the reference in an non-thread-safe manner, such as using a static member rather than a local variable:</p>

<pre><code>private static Definition riskyReference = null;
</code></pre>

<p>If one thread sets <code>riskyReference = new Definition(""key 1"");</code>, fills out the definition, and calls our <code>Definition.Register(ref riskyReference);</code> while another thread also decides to set <code>riskyReference = new Definition(""key 2"");</code>, are we guaranteed that in our Register method the <code>newDefinition</code> reference we're handling will not be modified on us by other threads (because the reference to the object was copied in and will be copied out when we return?), or can that other thread replace the object on us in the middle of our execution (if we're referencing a pointer to the original storage location???) and thus break our sanity-checking?</p>

<p>Note that this is different from changes to the underlying object itself, which are of course possible for a reference type (class), but can be easily guarded against by appropriate locking within that class.  We can't, however, guard changes to an external client's variable space itself!  We would have to make our own copy of the parameter at the top of the method and overwrite the parameter at the bottom (for example), but that would seem to make more sense for the compiler to do for us given the insanity of handling an unsafe reference.</p>

<p>So, I'd tend to think that the reference may be copied in and copied out by the compiler so that the method is handling a consistent reference to the original object (until it changes its own reference when it wants to) regardless of what might be happening to the original location on other threads.  But we're having trouble finding a definitive answer on that point in documenation and discussion of ref parameters.</p>

<p>Can anyone assuage my concern with a definitive citation?</p>

<p><strong>Edit for conclusion:</strong><br>
Having confirmed it with a multi-threaded code example (Thanks Marc!) and thinking about it further, it makes sense that it is indeed the <em>not-automatically-threadsafe</em> behavior which I was worred about.  One point of ""ref"" is to pass large structs by reference rather than copy them.  Another reason is that you might <em>want</em> to set up a long-term monitoring of a variable and need to pass a reference to it which will see changes to the variable (eg. changing between null and a live object), which an automatic copy-in/copy-out would not allow for.</p>

<p>So, to make our <code>Register</code> method robust against client insanity, we could implement it like:</p>

<pre><code>public static void Register(ref Definition newDefinition) {
    Definition theDefinition = newDefinition; // Copy in.
    //... Sanity checks, actual work...
    //...possibly changing theDefinition to a new Definition instance...
    newDefinition = theDefinition; // Copy out.
}
</code></pre>

<p>They'd still have their own threading issues as far as what they end up getting, but at least their insanity wouldn't break our own sanity-checking process and possibly slip a bad state past our checks.</p>

<p>I have a few components that make up a project I am working on. I have a smartclient, a webservice, a proxy for the webservice that the smartclient uses, a daemon and a common utilities library that is used in both the smartclient and the webservice.
Each of the components are related to the same work project.</p>

<p>I have structured my source tree so that each of the components is independent - in other words each component (smartclient, webservice, daemon, proxy, common utilities) has its own trunk and its own solution file as I want to be able to release each component independently. For components that are used by other components, such as in the case of the smartclient using the proxy and the common utilities, I have created releases that are handled like any other 3rd party library (binaries referenced instead of projects). Can anyone confirm that this is somewhat a best-practice and if not how should this be done otherwise?</p>

<p>I have been building releases of my components using tfs build and am wondering where I should put the releases if anywhere other than in the build output directory where all the tfs builds reside. Should I perhaps check them (e.g. proxy release assemblies to be used by the smartclient) into TFS along with any other 3rd party libraries and then branch the release assemblies where they are to be used (e.g. branch proxy release dlls to the smartclient lib directory)?</p>

<p>Do APIs all work in the same way? Can you use any programming language or only a specific language or does that depend on the API? Is there a common way to work with some of the major APIs? Do you know of any really basic API tutorials or do you really need to be au fait with particular coding languages before you start down that road?</p>

<p>There is no specific API that I ""need"" to work on but I would be interested to have a play with services such as Twitter, Flickr, Google Maps, Facebook, Last.fm, etc. if it's accessible.</p>

The idea is that you can wait in the standard line, often with a wait longer than an hour, or you can get a FastPass which allows you to come back during a specified time block (usually a couple hours later) and only wait for 10 minutes or less.  You can only be ""waiting"" for one ride at a time with a FastPass.</p>

<p>I have been trying to figure out the queue theory behind this concept, but the only explanation I have found is that it is designed to get people out of the lines and doing things that will bring in additional revenue (shopping, eating, etc).  </p>

<p>Is this why FastPass was implemented, or is there a real visitor efficiency problem that it solving?  Are there software applications that have applied similar logic?  Are there software applications that <em>should</em> apply similar logic?</p>

<p>Part of the problem I see with implementing something similar in software is that it is based on users choosing their queue.  Do to the faster wait cycles in software, I think a good application of this theory would require the application to be smart enough to know what queues to place people in based on their needs without requiring end-user choice.</p>

<p>If you create a class:</p>

<pre><code>Public Class ReferenceClass

    Private myBooleanValue As Boolean = False
    Public Property BooleanValue As Boolean
        Get
            Return myBooleanValue

        Set(value As Boolean)
            myBooleanValue = value
        End Set
    End Property

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>And then a class which actually uses this class as a property:</p>

<pre><code>Public Class UsingClass

     Private myReference As ReferenceClass
     Public Property Reference As ReferenceClass
        Get
             return myReference
         End Get
         Set(value As ReferenceClass)
             myReference = value
         End Set
     End Property

     Public Sub New(ByVal Reference As ReferenceClass)
         myReference = Reference
     End Sub

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>And then use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>Public Class RuntimeOrSomething

     Public Shared myReference As ReferenceClass
     Public Shared ReadOnly Property Reference As ReferenceClass
         Get
             If myReference Is Nothing Then myReference = new ReferenceClass()
             return myReference
         End Get
     End Property

     Public Shared Function BooleanCheck() As Boolean
         Reference.BooleanValue = True
         Dim tempClass As New UsingClass(Reference)
         tempClass.Reference.BooleanValue = False

         Return (tempClass.Reference.BooleanValue = Reference.BooleanValue)
     End Sub

     Public Shared Sub DoNothing()
          Reference.BooleanValue = True
          Dim someBoolean As Boolean = BooleanCheck

          ' Now Reference.Booleanvalue is ""False""
     End Sub

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>Now the function <code>BooleanCheck</code> will always return <code>true</code>, even though the reference is passed to the new class <code>UsingClass</code> ""by value"", not by reference. So a copy of the class is not made, but the local variable <code>myReference</code> in <code>UsingClass</code> still references/points to the property <code>Reference</code> in <code>RuntimeOrSomething</code>.</p>

<p>How can this be explained elegantly?</p>

Now I have some class in my application which needs to be able to check a certain permission in one of its methods. This class's constructor is currently public, i.e. used by API users.</p>

<p>Until a couple of weeks ago, I would have simply had my class call the following pseudo-code somewhere:</p>

<pre><code>     PermissionManager.getInstance().isReadPermissionEnabled(this)

<p>But since I have noticed everyone here hating singletons + this kind of coupling, I was wondering what the better solution would be, since the arguments I have read against singletons seem to make sense (not testable, high coupling, etc.).</p>

<p>So should I actually require API users to pass in a PermissionManager instance in the constructor of the class? Even though I only want a single PermissionManager instance to exist for my application?</p>

<p>Or am I going about this all wrong and should have a non-public constructor and a factory somewhere which passes in the instance of PermissionManager for me?</p>

While this approach works fine, the WAV files tend to be gigantic. A few seconds of sound end up being hundreds of kB. I'm faced with having a game download that's 95% audio!</p>

<p>The obvious option here would be to use MP3 or Ogg Vorbis. But I've had limited success with this - I can play MP3 using JLayer (but it plays in the same thread). As for Ogg, I've had no luck at all. Worse, JLayer's legal status is a bit on the dubious side.</p>

<p>So my question is to both Java developers and generally people who actually know something about sound: What do I do? Can I somehow ""trim the fat"" off my WAVs? Is there some way of playing Ogg in Java? Is there some other sound format I should use instead?</p>

   &lt;/mx:VBox&gt;
&lt;/mx:WindowedApplication&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The trouble is that the ""MainContent"" box might contain a huge list of subcomponents, and the presence of that long list causes a vertical scrollbar to appear at the highest level of the GUI, surrounding the ""MainContainer"" vbox.</p>

<p>It looks really silly, having scrollbars around the entire application window.</p>

<p>What I'm looking for instead is a solution where the scrollbar is only applied to the ""MainContent"" vbox (as well as the Navigation and HelpContent panels, if their content stretches past the window bounds).</p>

<p>I found a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/245292/best-way-to-size-containers-in-flex-to-obey-only-parent-containers-explicit-dim"">related question</a> on StackOverflow, where the problem's solution was to use ""autoLayout"" and ""verticalScrollPolicy"" attributes on parent containers.</p>

<p>So I tried adding autoLayout=""false"" and verticalScrollPolicy=""off"" attributes to all of the parent containers, as well as verticalScrollPolicy=""on"" to the ""MainContent"" vbox. But the end-result of that experiment was that the content was simply clipped from the main container (and a useless scrollbar with no thumb was added to the MainContent vbox).</p>

<p>Anyone know how to solve this?</p>

<p>Whenever there have any changes been made (by the license plugin) I want to push the changes to the github repo.</p>

git commit -m ""Added license headers""

<p><code>git add .</code> alone works, i.e., doesn't break the build, even if no files have been added. However, <code>git commit</code> breaks the build, if there aren't any changes at all.</p>

<p>I've tried many different servers to handle the flv recording. The resulting flvs play OK in Wimpy FLV Player, for example, except that the progress indicator doesn't move smoothly or in a regular fashion. This is a sign that there is something wrong and if I try to transcode them using ""ffmpeg -i input.flv output.avi"" (with or without the framerate option ""-r 15"") I don't get the right avi.</p>

<p>Here's what I tried and the kind of problem I get:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Using <a href=""http://osflash.org/red5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">red5</a> (v 0.6.3 and 0.7.0,
both on OS X 10.5.4 and Ubuntu 8.04)
and the publisher.html example it
includes. Here's the <a href=""http://www.marc-andre.ca/posts/blog/webcam/test-red5-publisher.flv"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">resulting
flv</a>. The indicator jumps towards
the end very rapidly.</p></li>
<li><p>Still using red5, but publishing ""live"" and starting the recording after a couple of seconds. I used <a href=""http://sziebert.net/posts/server-side-stream-recording-with-red5/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">these example files</a>. Here's the <a href=""http://www.marc-andre.ca/posts/blog/webcam/test-red5-live-sziebert.flv"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">resulting flv</a>. The indicator still jumps to the end very rapidly, no sound at all with this method...</p></li>
<li><p>Using <a href=""http://www.wowzamedia.com/products.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wowza Media Server Pro</a> (v 1.5.3, on my mac). The progress indicator doesn't jump to the end, but it moves more quickly at the very beginning. This is enough that conversion to other formats using ffmpeg will have the visual not synchronized properly with the audio. Just to be sure I tried the <a href=""http://www.marc-andre.ca/posts/blog/webcam/test-wowza.flv"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">video recorder that comes with it</a>, as well as using red5's publisher.html (with <a href=""http://www.marc-andre.ca/posts/blog/webcam/test-wowza-publisher.flv"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">identical results</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Using Flash Media Server 3 through an account hosted at <a href=""http://www.influxis.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">www.influxis.com</a>. I get yet another progression pattern. The progress indicator jumps a bit a the beginning and then becomes regular. Here's <a href=""http://www.marc-andre.ca/posts/blog/webcam/test-influxis.flv"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an example</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I know it is possible to record a ""flawless"" flv because facebook's video application does it (using red5?) Indeed, it's easy to look at the HTML source of facebook video and get the http URL to download the flvs they produce. When played back in Wimpy, the progress indicator is smooth, and transcoding with ""ffmpeg -i facebook.flv -r 15 facebook.avi"" produces a good avi. Here's <a href=""http://www.marc-andre.ca/posts/blog/webcam/test-facebook.flv"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an example</a>.</p>

<p>So, can I manage to get a good flv with a constant framerate?</p>

<p>PS: Server must be either installable on Linux or else be available at a reasonably priced hosting provider.</p>

<p>Edit: As pointed out, maybe the problem is not framerate per say but something else. I am not knowledgeable in video and I don't know how to inspect the examples I gave to check things out; maybe someone can shed some light on this.</p>

<p>I also wanted to replace the use of ASP.NET State Server (for Session State) with Memcached.
Now I am afraid it is not a good thing, because from what i understand,
Memcached is a cache server rather than a state server, is that true?</p>

<p>If I understand correctly, Memcached is not distributing data to other nodes in the Memcached farm.
Instead, a special hashing algorithm is used to determine which one of the nodes in the farm contains the data of a requested key,
whereas ASP.NET State Server distributes data ASAP when it has been added, to prevent a Single Point of Failure.</p>

<p>In other words, Memcached should be used only for performance reasons, the data stored in it should always be re-creatable,
in case the item has been removed to make room for new objects, or in case the single machine actually storing the data went down.</p>

<p>So can I not rely on Memcached only for storing session state data?
If i can't, then i don't understand how Memcached is often compared to and seen as
an alternative to using ScaleOut StateServer and ASP.NET State Server,
since these are really state servers, which is another thing, right?</p>

<p>I am now a bit unsure as to what is the best approach for high performance distributed session state in a web server farm.</p>

"332952","1","332964","","2008-12-02 03:29:44","","47","7273","<p>I have been noticing some very strange usage of O(1) in discussion of algorithms involving hashing and types of search, often in the context of using a dictionary type provided by the language system, or using dictionary or hash-array types used using array-index notation.</p>

<p>Basically, O(1) means bounded by a constant time and (typically) fixed space.  Some pretty fundamental operations are O(1), although using intermediate languages and special VMs tends to distort ones thinking here (e.g., how does one amortize the garbage collector and other dynamic processes over what would otherwise be O(1) activities).</p>

<p>But ignoring amortization of latencies, garbage-collection, and so on, I still don't understand how the leap to assumption that certain techniques that involve some kind of searching can be O(1) except under very special conditions.</p>

<p>Although I have noticed this before, an example just showed up in the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/330978/proper-collection-to-use-to-obtain-items-in-o1-time-in-c-net"">Pandincus question, ""'Proper’ collection to use to obtain items in O(1) time in C# .NET?""</a>.</p>

<p>As I remarked there, the only collection I know of that provides O(1) access as a guaranteed bound is a fixed-bound array with an integer index value.  The presumption is that the array is implemented by some mapping to random access memory that uses O(1) operations to locate the cell having that index.</p>

<p>For collections that involve some sort of searching to determine the location of a matching cell for a different kind of index (or for a sparse array with integer index), life is not so easy.  In particular, if there are collisons and congestion is possible, access is not exactly O(1).  And if the collection is flexible, one must recognize and amortize the cost of expanding the underlying structure (such as a tree or a hash table) for <strike>which</strike> congestion relief (e.g., high collision incidence or tree imbalance).</p>

<p>I would never have thought to speak of these flexible and dynamic structures as O(1).  Yet I see them offered up as O(1) solutions without any identification of the conditions that must be maintained to actually have O(1) access be assured (as well as have that constant be negligibly small).</p>

<p>THE QUESTION: All of this preparation is really for a question.  What is the casualness around O(1) and why is it accepted so blindly?  Is it recognized that even O(1) can be undesirably large, even though near-constant?  Or is O(1) simply the appropriation of a computational-complexity notion to informal use?  I'm puzzled.</p>

<p>UPDATE: The Answers and comments point out where I was casual about defining O(1) myself, and I have repaired that.  I am still looking for good answers, and some of the comment threads are rather more interesting than their answers, in a few cases.</p>

<pre><code>int x = 0;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000; ++i) {

<p>It is totally obvious that x is never changed so no matter how often you add 0 to itself it stays zero. So the compiler could in theory replace this with System.out.println(0).</p>

<p>First the compiler could notice that I am actually creating a string s of 100000 ""x"" so it could automatically use s StringBuilder instead, or even better directly replace it with the resulting string as it is always the same. Second, It does not recognize that I do not actually use the string at all, so the whole loop could be discarded!</p>

<p>The tag worked like this before the bug:
I pass the tag some collection as an attribute, and it displays it as a table. The collection was passed into the JSP from the controller.</p>

<p>After the bug:
I removed the attribute which set the collection. Instead, in the tag I check if the collection is null, and then grab it by name from the request (using a naming convention).</p>

<p>The thing that I didn't expect:
after the collection was initially set in the tag, it would never become null on subsequent executions! It was still defined as a non-requred attribute in the TLD.</p>

<ul>
<li>Go out and fetch records from a database table.  </li>
<li>Walk through all those records and for each column that contains a URL go out (using cURL) and make sure the URL is still valid.  </li>
<li>For each record a column is updated with a current time stamp indicating when it was last checked and some other db processing takes place.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyhow all this works well and good and does exactly what it is supposed to.  The problem is that I think performance could be <em>greatly</em> improved in terms of how I am validating the URL's with cURL.</p>

<p>Here is a brief (over simplified) excerpt from my code which demonstrates how cURL is being used:</p>

<pre><code>$ch = curl_init();
while($dbo = pg_fetch_object($dbres))
{
   // for each iteration set url to db record url
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $dbo-&gt;url);
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
   curl_exec($ch); // perform a cURL session
   $ihttp_code = intval(curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE));
   // do checks on $ihttp_code and update db
}
// do other stuff here
curl_close($ch);
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I am just reusing the same cURL handle the entire time but even if I strip out all over the processing (database or otherwise) the script still takes incredibly long to run.  Would changing any of the cURL options help improve performance?  Tuning timeout values / etc?  Any input would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Given a reasonably sized C-program (thousands of lines of code), on average, how many ASM-instructions would be generated. In other words, what's a realistic C-to-ASM instruction ratio? Feel free to make assumptions, such as 'with current x86 architectures'.</p>

<p>I tried to Google about this, but I couldn't find anything.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum</strong>: noticing how much confusion this question brought, I feel some need for an explanation: What I wanted to know by this answer, is to know, in practical terms, what ""3GHz"" means. I am fully aware of that the throughput per Herz varies tremendously depending on the architecture, your hardware, caches, bus speeds, and the position of the moon.</p>

<p>I am not after a precise and scientific answer, but rather an empirical answer that could be put into fathomable scales. </p>

<p>This isn't a trivial answer to place (as I became to notice), and this was my best effort at it. I know that the amount of resulting lines of ASM per lines of C varies depending on what you are doing. <code>i++</code> is not in the same neighborhood as <code>sqrt(23.1)</code> - I know this. Additionally, no matter what ASM I get out of the C, the ASM is interpreted into various sets of microcode within the processor, which, again, depends on whether you are running AMD, Intel or something else, and their respective generations. I'm aware of this aswell.</p>

<p>The ballpark answers I've got so far are what I have been after: A project large enough averages at about 2 lines of x86 ASM per 1 line of ANSI-C. Today's processors probably would average at about one ASM command per clock cycle, once the pipelines are filled, and given a sample big enough.</p>

<p>EDIT: I don't actually care about emulating the [Embed] tag's behaviour. I just want to be able to use an image file path with CursorManager. I'm sure I've seen this done in other situations, and surely the Flex people figured these things would not always be hard-coded?</p>

<p>EDIT2: To further simplify the problem, what I'm ideally looking for is a way to do the following:<code>CursorManager.setCursor(someHandyFunction(""myCursor.png""))</code>
If this is even possible, the question is what <code>someHandyFunction</code> should do?!</p>

<p>Ok, Basically, i want to create a web page that allow user to click a record button and record his voice thru his/her microphone and then convert it into mp3 file, then i want to click PLAY button to play what was recorded.</p>

<p>I have searched google alot and cannot find any codes that code do just that.</p>

<p>I have seen site that can do just that and it is using FLASH with RoR (i think).</p>

<p>Is there any way to record voice using ASP.NET?
I dont care if it need to combine with FLASH with ASP.NET, as long as it is possible.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Stephen M. Redd,</p>

<p>Appreciate your input. Yes, i know there is no simple way to accomplish what i am asking for. I also have researched and google alot on this question. Yes,I have come to know the best way to do this is through using FLASH with either FMS or RED5 (open source).</p>

<p>So i am trying to figure out how to write a simple FLASH (.swf) that i can record voice and then save into mp3 format to RED5 server.</p>

<p>Do you know or can you provide any directions to what i am asking above?</p>

<p>1) Tutorial on Microphone class in FLASH (i am reading some basic implementation from a book called ""FLASH Actionscript in a classroom"", which doesnt tell me how to record voice but ONLY how to use microphone object in FLASH)</p>

<p>2) Tutorial on how to setup and use RED5 (FMS is NOT an option due to its cost)</p>

<p>3) how to integrate 1) and 2) with asp.net and javascript (if there is any flashvars that the FLASH microphon .swf i can access so that ASP.NET can be used with javascript)</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>EDIT 2:</p>

<p>I cant consider to accept an answer BECAUSE none of them has provided a good answer.</p>

<p>Take a look on my question and read the comments i got, and you will see that my question was NOT being provided a good answer.</p>

<p>My question is to find a web-based Audio/Voice recorder so that the users can record their voice on the site.</p>

<p>To better convey what i exactly asked for, take a look at www.snapvine.com or www.pubclip.com . Both of them provide a way for users to record their voice right on the webpage.</p>

<p>So, i am looking for a FLASH component (.swf) similar to what they offer to integrate with my site.</p>

<p>EDIT 3:</p>

<p>This voice/microphone recording thing seem to be a challenging project for most developers.</p>

"694108","1","723727","","2009-03-29 04:41:34","","13","7310","<p>This question is a little involved. I wrote an algorithm for breaking up a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_polygon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">simple polygon</a> into convex subpolygons, but now I'm having trouble proving that it's <em>not</em> optimal (i.e. minimal number of convex polygons using <em>Steiner points</em> (added vertices)). My prof is adamant that it can't be done with a greedy algorithm such as this one, but I can't think of a counterexample.</p>

<p>So, if anyone can prove my algorithm is suboptimal (or optimal), I would appreciate it.</p>

<p>The easiest way to explain my algorithm with pictures (these are from an older suboptimal version)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jECBK.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>What my algorithm does, is extends the line segments around the point i across until it hits a point on the opposite edge.</p>

<p>If there is no vertex within this range, it creates a new one (the red point) and connects to that:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SQRpU.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>If there <em>is</em> one or more vertices in the range, it connects to the closest one. This <em>usually</em> produces a decomposition with the fewest number of convex polygons:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jj9Vh.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>However, in some cases it can fail -- in the following figure, if it happens to connect the middle green line first, this will create an extra unneeded polygon. To this I propose double checking all the edges (diagonals) we've added, and check that they are all still necessary. If not, remove it:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SkGN8.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>In some cases, however, this is not enough. See this figure:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pqw5F.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>Replacing a-b and c-d with a-c would yield a better solution. In this scenario though, there's no edges to remove so this poses  a problem. In this case I suggest an order of preference: when deciding which vertex to connect a reflex vertex to, it should choose the vertex with the highest priority:</p>

<p>lowest) closest vertex</p>

<p>med) closest reflex vertex</p>

<p>highest) closest reflex that is also in range when working backwards (hard to explain) --</p>

<p>In <a href=""http://www.sfu.ca/~mnb2/conv/case4.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this figure</a>, we can see that the reflex vertex 9 chose to connect to 12 (because it was closest), when it would have been better to connect to 5. Both vertices 5 and 12 are in the range as defined by the extended line segments 10-9 and 8-9, but vertex 5 should be given preference because 9 is within the range given by 4-5 and 6-5, but NOT in the range given by 13-12 and 11-12. i.e., the edge 9-12 elimates the reflex vertex at 9, but does NOT eliminate the reflex vertex at 12, but it CAN eliminate the reflex vertex at 5, so 5 should be given preference.</p>

<p>It is possible that the edge 5-12 will still exist with this modified version, but it can be removed during post-processing.</p>

<p>Are there any cases I've missed?</p>

<hr>

<p>Pseudo-code (requested by John Feminella) -- this is missing the bits under Figures 3 and 5</p>

<pre><code>assume vertices in `poly` are given in CCW order
let 'good reflex' (better term??) mean that if poly[i] is being compared with poly[j], then poly[i] is in the range given by the rays poly[j-1], poly[j] and poly[j+1], poly[j]

for each vertex poly[i]
    if poly[i] is reflex
        find the closest point of intersection given by the ray starting at poly[i-1] and extending in the direction of poly[i] (call this lower bound)
        repeat for the ray given by poly[i+1], poly[i] (call this upper bound)

        if there are no vertices along boundary of the polygon in the range given by the upper and lower bounds
            create a new vertex exactly half way between the lower and upper bound points (lower and upper will lie on the same edge)
            connect poly[i] to this new point
        else
            iterate along the vertices in the range given by the lower and upper bounds, for each vertex poly[j]
                if poly[j] is a 'good reflex'
                    if no other good reflexes have been found
                        save it (overwrite any other vertex found)
                    else
                        if it is closer then the other good reflexes vertices, save it
                else
                    if no good reflexes have been found and it is closer than the other vertices found, save it
            connect poly[i] to the best candidate
        repeat entire algorithm for both halves of the polygon that was just split
// no reflex vertices found, then `poly` is convex
save poly
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Turns out there is one more case I didn't anticipate: [Figure 5]</p>

<p>My algorithm will attempt to connect vertex 1 to 4, unless I add another check to make sure it can. So I propose stuffing everything ""in the range"" onto a priority queue using the priority scheme I mentioned above, then take the highest priority one, check if it can connect, if not, pop it off and use the next. I <em>think</em> this makes my algorithm O(r n log n) if I optimize it right.</p>

It will start to search through the files to find a term, but then at some point, it stops searching other files, and starts alternating between only two files.  This is very irritating, because I can't always find what I'm looking for.  In fact, to make matters worse, sometimes search simply doesn't find a term that I know exists, so I'll close the search form, switch documents, run the search again, and the term will be found. </p>

<p>I have managed to get a container to rotate around a point that is not its registration point but I’ve only managed this by turning off the clipping on a container then placing the contents somewhere other than (0,0,0). This does work, but it’s not very intuitive and sucks when trying to place several items or even if you need to move the rotation point.</p>

<p>Using the matrix3D class seems to be the way to go, but I'm not sure exactly how.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Additional info -
If my container is at (0,0,0) on the stage and I wish to rotate around the middle X coord of container then I translate by container.width/2 for the X then rotate and translate back again. This works fine.
BUT if my container is say at (10, 0, 0) then if I translate the same as above and add the extra 10 then it doesn't work.</p>

<p><strong>Soloution (which is complete rubbish - please explain if you can)</strong>
As has been suggested you need to translate, rotate, then -traslate.  I knew this but it never worked.<br>
BUT see the soloution below, I don't get it. (panel is the object I'm rotating, I call function both() )</p>

<pre><code>private function rotateOnly() : void {
        panel.transform.matrix3D.appendRotation(36, Vector3D.Y_AXIS);
}

private var valueToMove : Number = 300;
private var translateUpOrDown : Boolean = false;
private function translateOnly() : void {
    if(translateUpOrDown){
            panel.transform.matrix3D.appendTranslation(valueToMove, 0, 0);
    translateUpOrDown = false;
} else {
    panel.transform.matrix3D.appendTranslation(-valueToMove, -0,0);
    translateUpOrDown = true;
}
 }

 //I do not run both chunks of code here at once, this is only to show what I've tried   
 private function both() : void {
     //IF I call this function and call this chunk then the rotation works
        translateOnly();
        rotateOnly();
        translateOnly(); 


     //If I call this chunk which does the exact same as the above it does NOT work!!
        panel.transform.matrix3D.appendTranslation(valueToMove, 0,0);
panel.transform.matrix3D.appendRotation(36, Vector3D.Y_AXIS);
panel.transform.matrix3D.appendTranslation(-valueToMove, 0,0); 
 }

However, on the second iteration I get <code>SocketException</code>, Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted.<br>
However, the socket should be closed, <code>netstat -a</code> doesn't show that I'm listening on that port or anything. The code that throws the exception is:</p>

<pre><code>_bindedLocalSocket = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp);

This is much more relevant now that <a href=""http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">all chips are going multicore</a>, and it'll be even more relevant when there are thousands of cores on a chip instead of just a few.</p>

<p>My questions are: </p>

<ol>
<li>How does this affect your software roadmap?</li>
<li>I'm particularly interested in real stories about how multicore is affecting different software domains, so specify what kind of development you do in your answer (<em>e.g.</em> server side, client-side apps, scientific computing, etc).</li>
<li>What are you doing with your existing code to take advantage of multicore machines, and what challenges have you faced?  Are you using <a href=""http://www.openmp.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">OpenMP</a>, <a href=""http://www.erlang.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Erlang</a>, <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Haskell</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA"" rel=""noreferrer"">CUDA</a>, <a href=""http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">TBB</a>, <a href=""http://upc.lbl.gov/"" rel=""noreferrer"">UPC</a> or something else?</li>
<li>What do you plan to do as concurrency levels continue to increase, and how will you deal with hundreds or thousands of cores?</li>
<li>If your domain <em>doesn't</em> easily benefit from parallel computation, then explaining why is interesting, too.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, I've framed this as a multicore question, but feel free to talk about other types of parallel computing.  If you're porting part of your app to use <a href=""http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">MapReduce</a>, or if <a href=""http://www.open-mpi.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">MPI</a> on large clusters is the paradigm for you, then definitely mention that, too.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> If you do answer #5, mention whether you think things will change if there get to be more cores (100, 1000, etc) than you can feed with available memory bandwidth (seeing as how bandwidth is getting smaller and smaller per core).  Can you still use the remaining cores for your application?</p>

<p>This part works fine, however when you move the focus to something else, such as a textbox, or a messagebox is displayed, the listviewitem loses focus ie the highlight on the row is no longer displayed.

<pre><code>/**
 * Interface for an enumeration, each element of which can be uniquely identified by it's code
 */
public interface CodableEnum {

    /**
     * Get the element with a particular code

    /**
     * Get the code that identifies an element of the enum
     * @return
     */
    public String getCode();
}
</code></pre>

<p>A typical example is:</p>

<pre><code>public enum IMType implements CodableEnum {

    MSN_MESSENGER(""msn_messenger""),
    GOOGLE_TALK(""google_talk""),
    SKYPE(""skype""),
    YAHOO_MESSENGER(""yahoo_messenger"");

    private final String code;

    IMType (String code) {
        this.code = code;
    }

    public String getCode() {
        return code;
    }   

    public IMType getByCode(String code) {
        for (IMType e : IMType.values()) {
            if (e.getCode().equalsIgnoreCase(code)) {
                return e;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can imagine these methods are virtually identical in all implementations of CodableEnum. I would like to eliminate this duplication, but frankly don't know how. I tried using a class such as the following:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class DefaultCodableEnum implements CodableEnum {

    private final String code;

    DefaultCodableEnum(String code) {
        this.code = code;
    }

    public String getCode() {
        return this.code;
    }   

    public abstract CodableEnum getByCode(String code);  
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this turns out to be fairly useless because:</p>

<ol>
<li>An enum cannot extend a class</li>
<li>Elements of an enum (SKYPE, GOOGLE_TALK, etc.) cannot extend a class</li>
<li>I cannot provide a default implementation of getByCode(), because DefaultCodableEnum is not itself an Enum. I tried changing DefaultCodableEnum to extend java.lang.Enum, but this doesn't appear to be allowed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any suggestions that do not rely on reflection?

<p>There are 2 linked lists, each node's store a value from 1 through 9 (indicating one index of the number). Hence 123 would be a linked list 1->2->3</p>

<p>The task was to create a function:</p>

<p><code>static LinkedListNode getSum(LinkedListNode a, LinkedListNode b)</code> </p>

<p>that would return the sum of the values in the 2 linked list arguements.</p>

<p>If the array a is: 1->2->3->4</p>

<p>And the array b is: 5->6->7->8</p>

<p>The answer should be: 6->9->1->2</p>

<p>Here is my algorithm:</p>

<p>Go through each node in a and b, get the values as an integer and add them. Create a new linked list with the those values.</p>

<p>Here is the code: It runs with a complexity of O(3n) roughly I assume. Once through each of the array inputs and once to create the output array.</p>

Now, deallocation (finalization, however you want to call it) can fail, in which case exceptions are really the only way to let anybody upstairs know of our deallocation problem. But then again, throwing-destructors are a bad idea because of the possibility of exceptions being thrown during stack unwinding. <code>std::uncaught_exception()</code> lets you know when that happens, but not much more, so aside from letting you log a message before termination there's not much you can do, unless you're willing to leave your program in an undefined state, where some stuff is deallocated/finalized and some not.</p>

<p>One approach is to have no-throw destructors. But in many cases that just hides a real error. Our destructor might, for example, be closing some RAII-managed DB connections as a result of some exception being thrown, and those DB connections might fail to close. This doesn't necessarily mean we're ok with the program terminating at this point. On the other hand, logging and tracing these errors isn't really a solution for every case; otherwise we would have had no need for exceptions to begin with. 
With no-throw destructors we also find ourselves having to create ""reset()"" functions that are supposed to be called before destruction - but that just defeats the whole purpose of RAII.</p>

<p>Another approach is just to <a href=""http://www.kolpackov.net/projects/c++/eh/dtor-1.xhtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">let the program terminate</a>, as it's the most predictable thing you can do.</p>

<p>Some people suggest chaining exceptions, so that more than one error can be handled at a time. But I honestly never actually seen that done in C++ and I've no idea how to implement such a thing.</p>

<p>So it's either RAII or exceptions. Isn't it? I'm leaning toward no-throw destructors; mainly because it keeps things simple(r). But I really hope there's a better solution, because, as I said, the more we use RAII, the more we find ourselves using dtors that do non-trivial things.</p>

<p>I've faced the strangest problem with Visual Studio C# debugger in my career. In short, after a break point in my code was hit I cannot step through the code. <kbd>F11</kbd> (step into) and <kbd>F10</kbd> (step over) work for several times, but eventually Visual Studio performs <kbd>F5</kbd> (continue) action. I am still able to debug using break point on every line.</p>

<p>This behavior reproduces on each project developer's machine. It's Visual Studio SP1 everywhere.</p>

<p>I've checked every (as far as I understand) option. I've disabled ""Just My Code"". I've disabled ""step through properties"". I've disabled automatic property evaluation. In despair, I've recreated all project and solution files from scratch.</p>

<p>Is there any solution to my problem?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> This behavior could be reproduced only on this project.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong> This does not seems like threading problem: it reproduces under Visual Studio's developer web server...</p>

There are some cases where this could be favorable, for example if container managed transactions are used and something should be accomplished in a new transaction.</p>

<p>An example how this could work:</p>

<p>Foo.java:</p>

<pre><code>@Local
public interface FoO {
    public void doSomething();
    public void processWithNewTransaction(); // this should actually be private
}
</code></pre>

<p>FooBean.java:</p>

<pre><code>@Stateless
public class FooBean implements Foo {

    @EJB
    private Foo foo;

    public void doSomething() {
        ...
        foo.processWithNewTransaction();
        ...
    }

    @TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRES_NEW)
    public void processWithNewTransaction() {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I extract <code>processWithNewTransaction()</code> to another bean, it would need to be exposed as a public method in the interface, even though it should be called only by <code>FooBean</code>. (The same issue is with my code above, that's why there is a comment in the interface definition.)</p>

<p>One solution would be to switch to bean managed transactions. However this would require changing the whole bean to manage its own transactions, and would add a lot of boiler plate to all methods.</p>

<ul>
<li>First the user inputs the content and chooses a path to an image</li>
<li>When he clicks preview, the info is once again shown so that he can confirm</li>
<li>Once confirmed the info is persisted in the database</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem with this is that I don't want to store uploaded images in the DB before the user actually confirms. Instead I store them as temporary files and put them in DB only after final confirmation.</p>

<p>Since I also want my application to run in medium trust, I have write permissions only to the application directory and nowhere outside. I even want to limit write permissions for the ASPNET / NETWORK SERVICE user to the ~/App_Data folder.

<p>How do you advise I keep these temp files instead? The pool is not restarted if I update a file - only on create or rename. But I don't think I can store whole images in a single file for all users. What do you think?</p>

<p><b>UPDATE</b>: I should note that I'm using a third party control for upload. It gives me programmatic access to the binary stream of the file contents after upload, but I cannot keep this after a second postback (the first step and postback actually does the upload).</p>

<p>The ""ID"" elements aren't always there and so my solution to this was the Count() jazz above.  But I'm wondering if someone has a better way to do this.  I'm still getting comfortable with this new stuff and I suspect that there may be a better way to do this than how I'm currently doing it.</p>

<p>Is there a better/more preferred way to do what I want?</p>

<hr>

<p>Hi,
in my current project I have to use some kind of interface lib. The function names are given by this interface, what this functions do is developers choice. As far as I can tell a project shall use this functions and when it comes to compiling you choose the lib and with it the functionality. What I try to do is to use an existing lib and my lib at the same time by wrapping the other and call it in mein functions:</p>

<p>otherlib:</p>

<pre><code>int function1 (int a) {
// do something
}
</code></pre>

<p>mylib:</p>

<pre><code>int function1 (int a) {
//my code here
    otherlib::function1(a);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Problem is I don't have access to the other lib and the other lib doesn't have any namespaces. I already tried</p>

<pre><code>namespace old {
    #include ""otherlib.h""
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then call the old function by old::function1 in my function. This works as long as it's only header file. The lib exports it's symbol back into global space. Also something like</p>

<pre><code>namespace new {
    function1 (int a) {
        ::function1(a);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>didn't work. Last but not least I tried ifdefs and defines suggested <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/189921/how-to-handle-a-class-name-conflict-when-porting-old-code"">here</a></p>

<p>but I wasn't successful.</p>

<p>Any ideas how to solve this? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>EDIT: I neither have access to the old lib nor the project both libs shall be used in.</p>

<p>EDIT2: at least the old lib is a static one</p>

You can however look up the entity by it's foreign key and then set the entity as the foreign entity using the entity relationship.  (I've taken out the enum here and used integer values for simplicity). i.e. If I have a loaded Appointment entity and an associated AppoinmentStatus Entity I can't do this:-</p>

<pre><code>ExistingAppointment.AppointmentStatusID = 7
</code></pre>

<p>But I can do this:-</p>

<pre><code>ExistingAppointment.AppointmentStatus = (From appstat In db.AppointmentStatus _
                                        Where appstat.StatusID = 7 _
                                        Select appstat).Single
</code></pre>

<p>I have this kind of thing littering my code and I'd like to refactor.  So...</p>

<p>I could obviously use a helper method in a module like this:-</p>

<pre><code>
Module Helper
    Public Shared Function GetAppointmentStatus(ByVal AppStatusID As Integer) As AppointmentStatus
        GetAppointmentStatus = (From appstat In db.AppointmentStatus _
                                       Where appstat.AppointmentStatusID = AppStatus _
                                       Select appstat).Single
    End Function
End Module
</code></pre>

<p>I could even make this into an extension method, like this.</p>

<pre><code>
Imports System.Runtime.CompilerServices
Module Helper
Extension()> _
    Public Shared Function GetAppointmentStatus(ByVal db as DataClassesDataContext, ByVal AppStatusID As Integer) As AppointmentStatus
        GetAppointmentStatus = (From appstat In db.AppointmentStatus _
                                       Where appstat.AppointmentStatusID = AppStatusID _
                                       Select appstat).Single
    End Function
End Module
</code></pre>

<p>I could also put this in the Linq to SQL partial class, like this.</p>

<pre><code>
Partial Public Class DataClassesDataContext    
    Public Function GetAppointmentStatus(ByVal AppStatusID As Integer) As AppointmentStatus
        GetAppointmentStatus = (From appstat In Me.AppointmentStatus _
                                       Where appstat.AppointmentStatusID = AppStatusID _
                                       Select appstat).Single
    End Function
End Class
</code></pre>

<p>Further I could put the code in the Linq to SQL Appointment Entity partial class like this:-</p>

<pre><code>
Partial Public Class Appointment    
    Public Function GetAppointmentStatus(ByVal db as DataClassesDataContext, ByVal AppStatusID As Integer) As AppointmentStatus
            GetAppointmentStatus = (From appstat In db.AppointmentStatus _
                                       Where appstat.AppointmentStatusID = AppStatusID _
                                       Select appstat).Single
    End Function
End Class
</code></pre>

<p>Following previous answers on stackoverflow I used umdh from the microsoft debugging tools to track down one memory leak.  However there is still more leaks and the results of umdh don't match up with my perfmon results.</p>

<p>First umdh does still reports this leak, the stack trace is:</p>

<pre><code>+   36192 ( 2082056 - 2045864)    251 allocs    BackTraceCB
+       4 (    251 -    247)    BackTraceCB allocations

    ntdll!RtlAllocateHeap+00000E9F
    MSVCR80!malloc+0000007A
</code></pre>

<p>This is no use as the first call is malloc, it doesn't say what called it.  I have my doubts about this leak as it is reported both when the application is processing transactions and when it is idle.  But I can clearly see that no memory is leaking when it is idle.  And the memory leaks reported when processing the transactions are not proportional to the transactions processed as perfmon reports.</p>

<p>umhd does not show any other leaks, although I know there is at least one more not shown.  I have just learn from searching the net that a windows application can have multiple heaps.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Could it be that umhd only reports memory usage from one of these heap?  eg the default or crt heap?  </li>
<li>How can I track memory usage in other heaps?  </li>
<li>And how do find out what dlls / modules are using the other heaps?</li>

<p>I like the polymorphic container solution. Thank you SO, for bringing that to my attention :)</p>

<hr>

<p>So, we have a need to create a relatively generic container type object. It also happens to encapsulate some business related logic. However, we need to store essentially arbitrary data in this container - everything from primitive data types to complex classes.</p>

<p>Thus, one would immediately jump to the idea of a template class and be done with it. However, I have noticed C++ polymorphism and templates do not play well together. Being that there is some complex logic that we are going to have to work, I would rather just stick with either templates OR polymorphism, and not try to fight C++ by making it do both.</p>

<p>Finally, given that I want to do one or the other, I would prefer polymorphism. I find it much easier to represent constraints like ""this container contains Comparable types"" - a la java.</p>

<p>Bringing me to the topic of question: At the most abstract, I imagine that I could have a ""Container"" pure virtual interface that has something akin to ""push(void* data) and pop(void* data)"" (for the record, I am not actually trying to implement a stack).</p>

<p>However, I don't really like void* at the top level, not to mention the signature is going to change every time I want to add a constraint to the type of data a concrete container can work with.</p>

<p>Summarizing: We have relatively complex containers that have various ways to retrieve elements. We want to be able to vary the constraints on the elements that can go into the containers. Elements should work with multiple kinds of containers (so long as they meet the constraints of that particular container).</p>

<p>Edit: I should also mention that the containers themselves need to be polymorphic. That is my primary reason for not wanting to use templated C++.</p>

<p>So - should I drop my love for Java type interfaces and go with templates? Should I use void* and statically cast everything? Or should I go with an empty class definition ""Element"" that declares nothing and use that as my top level class in the ""Element"" hierarchy?</p>

<p>One of the reasons why I love stack overflow is that many of the responses provide some interesting insight on other approaches that I hadn't not have even considered. So thank you in advance for your insights and comments.</p>

The device for what it's worth is /dev/ttyUSB0. I'd like to have my program that writes to this device be able to have exclusive access to the device, so as to not have any interference from other instances of the program running at the same time.</p>

<p>I see that there's a ioctl option called TIOCEXCL which will prevent additonal open's of the device to wit ""multiple open() calls to the same file will succeed unless the TIOCEXCL ioctl is issued. This will prevent additional opens except by root-owned processes."" I tested this and it works just as advertised: if a non-root user tries to open /dev/ttyUSB0 (once I changed the permissions) then the open fails with something like ""device busy"" and if a root user tries to open it, it works.</p>

<p>What I ideally want is a way to this exclusive access to the tty to work for root users. So I'd have multiple root users using the program that writes to the LCD, but somehow their access to the LCD (tty) would be serialized. Apparently the TIOCEXCL ioctl option will not work for me since it doesn't stop root users from opening an already-opened tty device.</p>

<p>I guess there are a number of options here, but I am reaching out to all ya'll to see if you might have other thoughts or suggestions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Maybe I'm missing something about using TIOCEXCL...</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe there's some other way via open() or ioctl() or what-not to get exclusive access.</p></li>
<li><p>If there was some way I could detect that some other process has the device open, I could just wait and retry. I know about lsof but I'm loath to invoke it from inside this program just to learn this. And there are race conditions with that. (Maybe I can get over that? :) )</p></li>
<li><p>I could implement locking like apparently used to be done to get exclusive access to tty devices.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Update 1:</p>

<p>Since the only program writing to the LCD device is mine, I am inclined to do something like the following (pseudo-code) to lock inside the code:</p>

<pre><code>f = open(""/dev/ttyUSB0"", O_RDWR)
flock(f, LOCK_EX)

// do any ioctl's, etc.

// do any write's

// sleep a tad to not flash messages too fast on LCD
nanosleep({0, 250000000}, NULL)

flock(f, LOCK_UN)
close(f)

<p>I then use some JavaScript to decipher all mailto links which have this <code>(a)</code> sign in the email and convert them to <code>@</code> on page load.</p>

Both ends will have a GUI front end and will probably only need to pass simple data like Id's and possibly have a mechanism where it indicates to the other app what process/functionality to use. <br/>
Eg One of the applications will be a CRM system in C# that when a row in a grid is double clicked would pass say the customerId and a message to open that customer in the Customer Form of the MFC app.</p>

<p>Array type 2: Since this array can grow as items are added to it, I use the sizeof to count the number of entries in it. The size would be converted to a constant by the compiler so there shouldn't be any runtime penalty to doing it this way.</p>

I have tried a few times, but it has taken more than 30 minutes for the create trigger statement to complete and I've cancelled it.  </p>

<p>The table is one that gets read/written to often by a couple different processes.  I have disabled the scheduled jobs that update the table and attempted at times when there is less activity on the table, but I'm not able to stop everything that accesses the table.</p>

<p>I do not believe there is a problem with the create trigger statement itself.  The create trigger statement was successful and quick in a test environment, and the trigger works correctly when rows are inserted/updated to the table. Although when I created the trigger on the test database there was no load on the table and it had considerably less rows, which is different than on the live/production database (100 vs. 13,000,000+).</p>

<p>The order of the key/value pairs is intentional, as I'm turning the object into an HTML select box such as this:</p>

    arr.push(

    );
}

arr.push(""&lt;\/select&gt;"");

return arr.join("""");
</code></pre>

<p>This all works fine in IE, FireFox and Opera.</p>

<p>However in Chrome, the order comes out all weird:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select id=""ddl_sw"" name=""ddl_sw""&gt;
&lt;option value=""""&gt;== SELECT WEEK ==&lt;/option&gt;

&lt;option value=""200902""&gt;02 / 2009 (Fiscal 2009)&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=""200907""&gt;07 / 2009 (Fiscal 2009)&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=""200904""&gt;04 / 2009 (Fiscal 2009)&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=""200909""&gt;09 / 2009 (Fiscal 2009)&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=""200903""&gt;03 / 2009 (Fiscal 2009)&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=""200905""&gt;05 / 2009 (Fiscal 2009)&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=""200901""&gt;01 / 2009 (Fiscal 2009)&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=""200910""&gt;10 / 2009 (Fiscal 2009)&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=""200911""&gt;11 / 2009 (Fiscal 2009)&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=""200851""&gt;51 / 2008 (Fiscal 2009)&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: This order, though weird, does not change on subsequent refreshes. It's always in this order.</p>

<p>So, what is Chrome doing? Some optimization in how it processes the loop?</p>

<p>In the first place, am I wrong to rely on the order that the key/value pairs are declared in <em>any</em> associative array?</p>

<p>I never questioned it before, I just assumed the order would hold because this technique has always worked for me in the other browsers. But I suppose I've never seen it stated anywhere that the order is guaranteed. Maybe it's not?</p>

<p>Any insight would be awesome.
Thanks.</p>

<p>I even tried defining the functions as <code>extern</code>, in a (vain) attempt to just declare the functions and let the implementation come true only on the <code>.c</code>.</p>

<p>This is an abridged description of my code:</p>

int put(int handler, int* data, int&amp; datasize, int&amp; numrows);
int close(int handler);

int get(int handler, int date[2], int time[2], int* data, int&amp; rowsize, int&amp; numrows) {
    ....
}
...

<p><strong>Compilation &amp; linkage:</strong></p>

<pre><code>g++ -o module1.o -c module1.cpp
g++ -o module2.o -c module2.cpp
g++ -fPIC -shared -o library.so module1.o module2.o
</code></pre>

<p>As I said, it compiles OK. The problem is during linkage, where the linker ""sees"" that there are two implemented functions from <code>module1.h</code>: one from the inclusion of <code>module1.h</code> in <code>module1.cpp</code>; and the other from the inclusion of <code>module1.h</code> together with <code>module2.h</code> in <code>module2.cpp</code>.</p>

<p>I know the functions are supposed to be declared, but I'm obviously doing a faux-pas.

I want to provide a working piece of code without actually having to make the user install what are essentially dependencies for optional features and I don't actually want to import things I'm not going to use so I thought code like this would be ""good solution"":</p>

<pre><code>---- IN LOADING FUNCTION ----
features = []

for path in sys.path:
       if os.path.exists(os.path.join(path, 'pynotify')):
              features.append('pynotify')
       if os.path.exists(os.path.join(path, 'gnomekeyring.so')):
              features.append('gnome-keyring')

#user dialog to ask for stuff
#notifications available, do you want them enabled?
dlg = ConfigDialog(features)

if not dlg.get_notifications():
    features.remove('pynotify')


service_start(features ...)

---- SOMEWHERE ELSE ------

def service_start(features, other_config):

        if 'pynotify' in features:
               import pynotify
               #use pynotify...
</code></pre>

<p>There are some issues however. If a user formats his machine and installs the newest version of his OS and redeploys this application, features suddenly disappear without warning. The solution is to present this on the configuration window:</p>

<pre><code>if 'pynotify' in features:
    #gtk checkbox
else:
    #gtk label reading ""Get pynotify and enjoy notification pop ups!""
</code></pre>

<p>But if this is say, a mac, how do I know I'm not sending the user on a wild goose chase looking for a dependency they can never fill?</p>

<p>The second problem is the:</p>

<pre><code>if os.path.exists(os.path.join(path, 'gnomekeyring.so')):
</code></pre>

<p>issue. Can I be sure that the file is always called gnomekeyring.so across all the linux distros?</p>

<p>How do other people test these features? The problem with the basic</p>

<pre><code>try:
    import pynotify
except:
    pynotify = disabled
</code></pre>

<p>is that the code is global, these might be littered around and even if the user doesn't want pynotify....it's loaded anyway.</p>

<p>So what do people think is the best way to solve this problem?</p>

<p>Hi, 
   I'm attempting to send an encrypted email from php to outlook.  As such, I need to generate a certificate to import into outlook.  I had no problem generating a set of keys using openssl and the CA.pl script that comes with it, but when I try to run the command to generate the PKCS12 file to import into outlook it complains about a missing ""demoCA"" directory.  It appears this directory is a part of openssl, and is referenced in the openssl config... but i have no idea where it is.  I've searched the drive in many ways from grep to spotlight (on os x, though i really wasn't expecting spotlight to find anything), and can't come up with anything.  </p>

<p>The command I was trying to run is:</p>

<pre><code>$ openssl ca -cert newcert.pem -ss_cert newcert.pem
Using configuration from /sw/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf
./demoCA/private/cakey.pem: No such file or directory trying to load CA private key

<ul>
<li>A simple number/letter combination not more than 25-30 alphanumeric characters long (think Microsoft product keys)</li>
<li>Does not require the user to enter any personal information (like an email address) as part of the verification</li>
</ul>

<p>I've been thinking about this a (very little) bit, and I think public key cryptography is a good place to start. I could generate a string that identifies the license (like SKU + plain ole' integral serial number), hash it, encrypt it, and encode the serial number + identifier into a 25 digit (or so) alphanumeric key. The app would then decode the key into a serial number and ""signature"", generate an identifier hash, decrypt the ""signature"" using a corresponding public key and compare it against the generated identifier hash.</p>

<p>Essentially, the product key carries two pieces of data: the serial number the user claims to own plus a signature of sorts the program can use to verify that claim. I don't know if 25 alphanumeric characters (which encode 5 bits each for a realistic total of 120 bits) is enough for all this. But, it doesn't have to be cryptographically secure, just enough that the codes aren't easily guessable. I'm OK with short key lengths and short hashes.</p>

<p>As far as implementation goes, the app is written in Objective-C for Mac OS X, but given how easy it is to inject code into Cocoa apps, I'll probably write the verification code in straight C.</p>

<h3>Quick description of my problem</h3>

<p>I used <a href=""http://ui.jquery.com/themeroller"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ThemeRoller</a> to download a jQueryUI theme, which also generates a jQueryUI javascript file.  I'd rather use the file hosted at Google (<code>http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.5.3/jquery-ui.min.js</code>), but when I do this the theme is not picked up.  I find it hard to believe that I must use the ThemeRoller-generated script, because if this were the case then the Google-hosted jQueryUI would be completely useless!  What am I doing wrong here??</p>

<hr>

<h3>More details</h3>

<p>So I downloaded the ""Smoothness"" theme from Themeroller as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href=""http://ui.jquery.com/themeroller"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ThemeRoller</a> site.</li>
<li>Click ""Gallery"" button.</li>
<li>Click ""Download"" button beneath ""Smoothness"" theme.</li>
<li>Extract the .zip file (using folder names) to a local directory (say, <code>C:\jqueryui_test</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I created a very simple <code>test.html</code> file in that same directory, which has the following content:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd""&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;link type=""text/css"" href=""ui.all.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" /&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.1/jquery.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.5.3/jquery-ui.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
$(function() {
  $(""#datepicker"").datepicker({inline: true});
});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div id=""datepicker""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I open <code>test.html</code> in my browser, the date picker component is not styled (no background images or anything).  But if I change the Google-hosted <code>jquery-ui.min.js</code> line to the one that ThemeRoller generated (<code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""jquery.ui.all.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>), the page is styled as expected.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong>  The answer I accepted wasn't really the final solution, but it lead me down the right path.  Turns out if you just download JQueryUI, you get lots of stuff.  The Google-hosted file can just replace the ""jquery.ui.all.js"" file, but you still need the ""themes"" directory.  Plus, the Themeroller themes don't work very well with 1.5.3 (even the ""1.5.3 users"" link).  Since this was only for an admin page, I just used the ""flora"" theme that was built in.  Looks like jQuery UI 1.6 is much better but it's not in ""stable"" release yet (as of this writing...).</p>

<p>I have c# code (part of a test framework that will never be run except under a debugger) like this who's point it to avoid actually catching the exception as that makes debugging the code in the unwound part of the stack a royal pain.</p>

<pre><code>Bool bad = true;
try
{
   MightThrow();
   bad = false;
}
finally
{
   if(bad) DoSomeLoggingOnFailure();

   //// Does not catch!!!! 
   //// exception continues to unwind stack.

   //// Note that re throwing the exception is NOT
   //// the same as not catching it in the first place
}
</code></pre>

<p>is their a better way to do this?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A solution would have to behave exactly like that under the debugger with regards to un-caught exceptions. It would have to result in the only one first chance exception and the debugger breaking at the point that the exception was <em>originally</em> thrown, not in a catch block.</p>
  
  <p>Specifically I need the debugger on un-caught exceptions to stop a in side MightThrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following doesn't work because it fails to have the debugger break in the correct place</p>

<pre><code>try { ... } catch { throw; }

<p>key, loads the appropriate DLL(s) according to what is listed in <code>EventMessageFile</code> and finally uses <code>FormatMessage</code> to merge the event strings with the message DLL content to get the final event message text.  This is the recommended way, and although a bit of a pain, it works great.</p>

<p>Until... I go lookup the source and find it doesn't have an <code>EventMessageFile</code>, but rather a <code>ProvideGuid</code> entry.  This seems to be the new way (they show up on Vista and Windows 2008).  Uggh -- nothing to pass to FormatMessage for looking up the message text and merging in the data strings </p>

<p>:(</p>

<p>Searching the registry for the guid does lead to references to other files (http.sys in the case of the HTTP source), but I can never get the complete message text.  Do I have to use those <code>EvtOpenSession</code> APIs?  I'm hoping not since I already have the <code>EVENTLOGRECORD*</code> from a call to <code>ReadEventLog</code>, and the fact that the software needs to run on Windows 2003 where <code>EvtOpenSession</code> isn't supported (only available on Vista and Windows 2008).  NOTE: Some sources on Vista have ProviderGUID, and others have EventMessageFile, so the old method is still viable.</p>

<p>So what I'm after is a way to look at the ProviderGuid and get the DLL that needs to be passed to FormatMessage for displaying the complete event log message text.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As for Unicode, it works in PHP
  because most apps process it as
  binary. Yes, PHP is 8-bit clean. Try
  the equivalent of this in PHP: perl
  -Mutf8 -e 'print scalar reverse(""ほげほげ"")' You will get garbage,
  not ""げほげほ"". – jrockway</p>

<p>And unfortunately it is correct that PHPs unicode support atm is at best ""lacking"". This will <a href=""http://74.125.77.132/search?q=cache:X3t6LgxXRa0J:derickrethans.nl/files/php6-unicode.pdf+php6+unicode"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hopefully change drastically with PHP6</a>. </p>

<p>PHPs <a href=""http://no2.php.net/manual/en/ref.mbstring.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MultiByte functions</a> does provide the basic functionality you need to deal with unicode, but it is inconsistent and does lack a lot of functions. One of these is a function to reverse a string.</p>

<p>I of course wanted to reverse this text for no other reason then to figure out if it was possible. And I made a function to accomplish this enormous complex task of reversing this Unicode text, so you can relax a bit longer until PHP6.</p>

echo ""Showing results with encoding $defaultEnc.\n\n"";

$revNormal = strrev($text);

<p>if (record_id is not in new_table) or (record_id is in new_table, but the latest entry of it has a different data_field)</p>

  <p>insert it into the new_table and get the index_id</p>

I remember having to comment out a lot of logging calls in inner-loop-like scenarios (the 90% code) because of the overhead (<code>hotshot</code> indicated it was one of my biggest bottlenecks).</p>

<p>I wonder now if there's some canonical way to programmatically strip out logging calls in Python applications without commenting and uncommenting all the time. I'd think you could use inspection/recompilation or bytecode manipulation to do something like this and <strong>target only the code objects that are causing bottlenecks</strong>. This way, you could add a manipulator as a post-compilation step and use a centralized configuration file, like so:</p>

<pre><code>[Leave ERROR and above]
my_module.SomeClass.method_with_lots_of_warn_calls

[Leave WARN and above]
my_module.SomeOtherClass.method_with_lots_of_info_calls

[Leave INFO and above]
my_module.SomeWeirdClass.method_with_lots_of_debug_calls
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, <strong>you'd want to use it sparingly and probably with per-function granularity</strong> -- only for code objects that have shown <code>logging</code> to be a bottleneck. Anybody know of anything like this?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There are a few things that make this more difficult to do in a performant manner because of dynamic typing and late binding. For example, any calls to a method named <code>debug</code> may have to be wrapped with an <code>if not isinstance(log, Logger)</code>. In any case, I'm assuming all of the minor details can be overcome, either by a gentleman's agreement or some run-time checking. :-)</p>

Every few minutes, the page refreshes, which causes the app to generate new charts. (In other words, the entire chart generation process is bootstrapped by a client request.) The problem with this is that multiple clients hitting the same server would result in multiple requests to generate charts, but since the charts are the same for all users, there's really no reason to do this. I would like to prerender the charts in a background thread, which would be kicked off when the application starts, and then just serve the already-rendered charts to the client on request.</p>

<p>I don't see any ""sanctioned"" way in GWT to execute your own code at server startup. The only way I can think of to accomplish this is to create a servlet that gets loaded at startup by the application container, and kick off the chart generation thread in the init() method.</p>

I decided to give <a href=""http://check.sourceforge.net/doc/check.html/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">check</a> a try 
(I don't know if this is the right choice but if it's no good I can always try something else later on).</p>

<p>But since this concept of unit test and unit test frameworks is totally new to me, 
I started out to do some unit test on a really small test code (but I was totally lost anyway and it felt like I was missing something).</p>

<p>This is what I have done so far, I created the following file:</p>

<ul>
<li>main.c, a main that only calls a function called my_pow and prints the result.</li>
<li>my_pow.c, contains the function my_pow.</li>
<li>my_pow.h  </li>
<li>my_pow_test.c, I figured that I should place the unit code for the my_pow function here.</li>
</ul>

<p>(So the ""normal program"" is the main.c, my_pow.c and my_pow.h.)</p>

<p>This is my_pow.c</p>

<pre>
<code>
#include ""my_pow.h""
int my_pow(int a, int b)
{
    return (a*b);
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Then I figured that in my_pow_test.c I put something like this:</p>

<pre>
<code>
#include &lt;check.h&gt;
#include ""my_pow.h""

START_TEST (test_my_pow)
{
    /* unit test code */
}
END_TEST

//do I need some sort off main here that calls test_my_pow?

maybe CUnit is a better choice (I think I would try that as well and then make a educated choice).</p>

<p>Update: Thanks @philippe for indirectly pointing out that the on-line documentation is only half of the truth, 
the example code that clarifies what the documentation talks about was already installed with the check package.
In the Ubuntu case /usr/share/doc/check/example/tests/</p>

<p>Update: The code example was created so that you started out by looking at his first version, 
then the second one etc etc. So that you could follow how he creates a very basic test case/code from nothing up to something that is useful in a traditional TTD way. </p>

<p>And since my code was broken and I wanted the unit test to prove this, 
I cheated a little and tested against the real pow function.
Something like this: </p>

<pre>
<code>
START_TEST (test_my_pow1)
{
    int resultat = my_pow(3,3);
    int math     = pow(3,3);
    fail_unless ( resultat == math,
           ""Error on 3^3 != %d (%d)"",math, resultat);
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>However in the future I will not reproduce what is already in the stdlibs :-)</p>

I found a really good library, doing exactly what's needed, but it is written in Python. I decided to experiment with embedding Python code in C++, using the Boost.Python library.</p>

<p>The C++ code looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;boost/python.hpp&gt;

using namespace boost::python;

int main(int, char **) 
{
    Py_Initialize();

    try 
    {
        object module((handle&lt;&gt;(borrowed(PyImport_AddModule(""__main__"")))));

        object name_space = module.attr(""__dict__"");
        object ignored = exec(""from myModule import MyFunc\n""
                          ""MyFunc(\""some_arg\"")\n"",
                          name_space);

        std::string res = extract&lt;std::string&gt;(name_space[""result""]);
    } 
    catch (error_already_set) 
    {
        PyErr_Print();
    }

    Py_Finalize();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>A (very) simplified version of the Python code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>import thirdparty

def MyFunc(some_arg):
    result = thirdparty.go()
    print result
</code></pre>

<p>Now the problem is this: 
'MyFunc' executes fine, i can see the print of 'result'.
What i cannot do is read 'result' back from the C++ code. The extract command never finds 'result' in any namespace.
I tried defining 'result' as a global, i even tried returning a tuple, but i cannot get it to work.</p>

I've tried both ""127.0.0.1"" and ""localhost"" for host and ""80"" for port. (don't think it should matter, but apache2 is up and running)</p>

<p>When I ctrl+c out of my application, it obviously terminates but it does output the ""Connecting to string"" just before it does.</p>

<p>I am planning on building the example myself and seeing if the same problem occurs, and will definitely post the results here. Has anyone encountered this issue or knows what could possibly cause this behavior?</p>

<p>edit:<br>
The example runs just fine... I have some debugging to do I suppose.</p>

<p>second edit:<br>
I don't get it, the only thing that could be different is host/port.<br>

<pre><code>char host[] = ""localhost"";
char port[] = ""80"";

<p>third edit:<br>
it indeed seems to be blocking at connect, forgot to fflush(stdout). then it has to be a problem with the socket. going to do some more testing.</p>

stupid me, it wasn't blocking at all! I was just relying too much on console output.. </p>

<p>You've got several bug reports all showing the same problem. They're all cryptic with similar tales of how the problem occurred. You follow the steps but it doesn't reliably reproduce the problem. After some investigation and web searching, you suspect what might be going on and you are pretty sure you can fix it.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, without a reliable way to reproduce the original problem, you can't verify that it actually fixes the issue rather than having no effect at all or exacerbating and masking the real problem. You could just not fix it until it becomes reproducible every time, but it's a big bug and not fixing it would cause your users a lot of other problems.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>How do you go about verifying your change?</p>

<p>I think this is a very familiar scenario to anyone who has engineered software, so I'm sure there are a plethora of approaches and best practices to tackling bugs like this. We are currently looking at one of these problems on our project where I have spent some time determining the issue but have been unable to confirm my suspicions. A colleague is soak-testing my fix in the hopes that ""a day of running without a crash"" equates to ""it's fixed"". However, I'd prefer a more reliable approach and I figured there's a wealth of experience here on SO.</p>

<p>What does Stack Overflow think? What's the best answer when you're asked to do this by a client who, for instance, wants a few hundred people to fill out a survey?</p>

<p>(Don't bother just answering ""provide a link to a form on a website"". That's the obvious answer. I want to know specifically if there's a consensus about forms in email.)</p>

In all browsers it works fine, except in IE (all versions that I've tested) where the combobox expands for a splitsecond, showing a ""loading"" icon and then it disappears again. Clicking it again after this doesn't make it expand at all anymore. Basically: it's not being populated. </p>

<p>On the server side, everything is fine. The Controller action is reached (using ASP.NET MVC) which returns Json data. The Json is properly formed (all other browsers swallow it at least). </p>

<p>A weird thing is, that when I put a breakpoint in the Controller action, the JsonStore is properly filled on the client side. This to me indicates some sort of timing problem. </p>

<p>Another weird thing is that, every once in a while, it works fine. Perhaps because the timing is just right by accident or something.</p>

<p>If I set the combobox mode to 'local' and force a <code>.load()</code> on the remote datastore, it works fine in IE too. </p>

    hiddenName: 'CompanyID',

<p>BTW, I Don't know if that is of any importance, but the page I'm searching into comes from a ASP.NET application.</p>

<p>@rams
This event is launched many times for each page, so I figured it was each time a framed is loaded, even if i don't get to catch the one I'm looking for. If not, what would be the event to catch the frames content?</p>

<p>What I want to do is detect some precise info on a precise frame, then save it. later, a web page is loaded triggered by some user action, where I need the info I got from parsing the frame.</p>

I am using Subversion, with a copy of VisualSVN 1.6.1 installed on a Windows server.  On my PC I am using a combination of TortoiseSVN and the wonderful AnkhSVN Visual Studio plugin.  Everything works like a dream, but now I am trying use the <code>svn:keywords</code> feature so I can include <code>$Id$</code> at the top of all my source files.  Now, for existing files I can edit the SVN properties and add this keyword and it all works fine, but I want this done automatically for new files - and I cannot make it work.</p>

<p>According to the documentation you need to edit a special Subversion Config file located in your <code>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application Data\Subversion</code> folder.  My PC already had a copy of this file, so I changed it to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>[miscellany]
enable-auto-props = yes

[auto-props]
*.cpp = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
*.hpp = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
*.rc = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
*.rc2 = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
*.cc = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
*.c = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
*.h = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
*.wsf = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
*.js = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
*.htm = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
*.html = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
*.css = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id HeadURL Revision
</code></pre>

<p>I then added a new file to an existing Visual Studio project (from within Visual Studio), added <code>$Id$</code> to the top and committed it - but, alas, the <code>svn:keywords</code> property is not being set.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to get this working?  I even tried adding settings to the registry (in <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Config</code>) but still no joy.  I then tried messing with Config files on the SVN server itself, but nothing seems to work.</p>

<p>Here's the basic program flow I'm thinking of:</p>

<ol>
<li>User comes to page and is shown the last 10 messages</li>
<li>To get messages sent by others, the client javascript would request a URL with a timestamp parameter (set to the value of the last message the client received)</li>
<li>The server returns all messages (up to a max of 10) since that timestamp.</li>
</ol>

<p>The only issue is how often to poll the server. Obviously it should poll each time a new message is added, but when you're just reading others' messages it needs to automatically update.</p>

<p>Should it be a set time limit? eg: every 10 seconds. Or, should it vary depending on usage? eg: Check after 5 seconds. If there's no messages, don't check for another 10 seconds. If there's still no new messages, check in 15 seconds, then 20, up to maybe once every 30 seconds max. Each time there's a new message detected reset your timer back down to 5 seconds and start again.</p>

<p>I'm just concerned about putting unnecessary stress on the server, considering that we could have hundreds of users concurrently online.</p>

The code works great.  I've included a slightly simplified version without exception handling here just for reference - skip this code if you want to jump right the problem. If you have suggestions here, though, I'm all ears.</p>

<pre><code>    public List&lt;T&gt; ReturnList&lt;T&gt;() where T : new()
    {
        List&lt;T&gt; fdList = new List&lt;T&gt;();
        myCommand.CommandText = QueryString;
        SqlDataReader nwReader = myCommand.ExecuteReader();
        Type objectType = typeof (T);
        FieldInfo[] typeFields = objectType.GetFields();
        while (nwReader.Read())
        {
            T obj = new T();
            foreach (FieldInfo info in typeFields)
            {
                for (int i = 0; i &lt; nwReader.FieldCount; i++)
                {
                    if (info.Name == nwReader.GetName(i))
                    {
                        info.SetValue(obj, nwReader[i]);
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
            fdList.Add(obj);
        }
        nwReader.Close();
        return fdList;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>As I say, this works just fine.  However, I'd like to be able to call a similar function with an <em>anonymous class</em> for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Question #1: it appears that I must construct an anonymous class <strong>instance</strong> in my call to my anonymous version of this function - is this right?  An example call is:</p>

<pre><code>.ReturnList(new { ClientID = 1, FirstName = """", LastName = """", Birthdate = DateTime.Today });
</code></pre>

<p>Question #2: the anonymous version of my ReturnList function is below.  Can anyone tell me why the call to info.SetValue simply does nothing?  It doesn't return an error or anything but neither does it change the value of the target field.</p>

<pre><code>    public List&lt;T&gt; ReturnList&lt;T&gt;(T sample) 
    {
        List&lt;T&gt; fdList = new List&lt;T&gt;();
        myCommand.CommandText = QueryString;
        SqlDataReader nwReader = myCommand.ExecuteReader();
        // Cannot use FieldInfo[] on the type - it finds no fields.
        var properties = TypeDescriptor.GetProperties(sample); 
        while (nwReader.Read())
        {
            // No way to create a constructor so this call creates the object without calling a ctor. Could this be a source of the problem?
            T obj = (T)FormatterServices.GetUninitializedObject(typeof(T)); 
            foreach (PropertyDescriptor info in properties)  
            {
                for (int i = 0; i &lt; nwReader.FieldCount; i++)
                {
                    if (info.Name == nwReader.GetName(i))
                    {
                        // This loop runs fine but there is no change to obj!!
                        info.SetValue(obj, nwReader[i]);
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
            fdList.Add(obj);
        }
        nwReader.Close();
        return fdList;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> when I tried to use the FieldInfo array as I did in the function above, the typeFields array had zero elements (even though the objectType shows the field names - strange). Thus, I use TypeDescriptor.GetProperties instead.</p>

<p>Any other tips and guidance on the use of reflection or anonymous classes are appropriate here - I'm relatively new to this specific nook of the C# language.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I have to thank Jason for the key to solving this.  Below is the revised code that will create a list of anonymous class instances, filling the fields of each instance from a query.</p>

<pre><code>   public List&lt;T&gt; ReturnList&lt;T&gt;(T sample)
   {
       List&lt;T&gt; fdList = new List&lt;T&gt;();
       myCommand.CommandText = QueryString;
       SqlDataReader nwReader = myCommand.ExecuteReader();
       var properties = TypeDescriptor.GetProperties(sample);
       while (nwReader.Read())
       {
           int objIdx = 0;
           object[] objArray = new object[properties.Count];
           foreach (PropertyDescriptor info in properties) 
               objArray[objIdx++] = nwReader[info.Name];
           fdList.Add((T)Activator.CreateInstance(sample.GetType(), objArray));
       }
       nwReader.Close();
       return fdList;
   }
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the query has been constructed and the parameters initialized in previous calls to this object's methods. The original code had an inner/outer loop combination so that the user could have fields in their anonymous class that didn't match a field. However, in order to simplify the design, I've decided not to permit this and have instead adopted the db field access recommended by Jason.  Also, thanks to Dave Markle as well for helping me understand more about the tradeoffs in using Activator.CreateObject() versus GenUninitializedObject.</p>

<p>Normally when I build under Linux, in my Makefile I can add a call to pkg-config as an argument to gcc, so it comes out like so:</p>

<pre>
gcc example.c `pkg-config --libs --cflags gtk+-2.0` 
</pre>

<p>This works fine under Linux, but in cygwin I get:</p>

<pre>
:Invalid argument
make: *** [example] Error 1
</pre>

<p>Right now, I am just manually running pkg-config and pasting the output into the Makefile, which is truly terrible. Is there a good way to workaround or fix for this issue?</p>

<p>Make isn't the culprit. I can copy and paste the command line that make uses to call gcc, and that by itself will run gcc, which halts with "": Invalid argument"". </p>

<p>I wrote a small test program to print out command line arguments:</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; argc; i++)
    printf(""'%s'\n"", argv[i]);
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the single quotes.</p>

<pre>
$ pkg-config --libs gtk+-2.0
-Lc:/mingw/lib -lgtk-win32-2.0 -lgdk-win32-2.0 -latk-1.0 -lgdk_pixbuf-2.0 -lpang
owin32-1.0 -lgdi32 -lpangocairo-1.0 -lpango-1.0 -lcairo -lgobject-2.0 -lgmodule-

<p>Running through the test program:</p>

$ ./t `pkg-config --libs gtk+-2.0`

<p>Notice the one single quote on the last line. It looks like argc is one greater than it should be, and argv[argc - 1] is null. Running the same test on Linux does not have this result.</p>

<p>An emample would be</p>

<pre><code>Dim objBuilder
objBuilder = New StringBuilder

objBuilder.Append(Resources.SystemEmail.CSSStyle)
objBuilder.Append(""My Styled Email"")

Dim _Body As String = objBuilder.ToString()
</code></pre>

<p>This would build the body of the email</p>

<p>Is there any way to make a template file for an email or a better way to call a style sheet into one. </p>

<p>The code in my .resx file would be </p>

<pre><code>&lt;STYLE TYPE=""text/css""&gt;
&lt;!--
body
{

    font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial;

<p>Thread one manages the client connections. (There is only one client and one server)<br>
I call it my server thread.</p>

<p>Thread two manages sending messages to the client.  I call it my message processor thread.</p>

<p>Thread one is responsible, among other things sending a heartbeat to the client periodically.  </p>

<p>When programming I made an assumption that the sockets weren't thread safe, but the buffers were, and as long as I was using seperate buffers for the server and processor threads I would be fine. </p>

<p>I also made the assumption that the ""PrintWriter"" was analogous to the socket buffer in Java.  </p>

<p>Under these assumptions I wrote this function to send a heartbeat:</p>

<pre><code>public void sendHeartBeat(){
        logger.info(""Sending a hearbeat!"");
        PrintWriter printWriter=null;
        try {
            printWriter = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            logger.info(e.toString());
        }
        if(printWriter!=null){
            printWriter.print(""HEARTBEAT#"");
            printWriter.flush();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The other thread, the ""processor"" one does something similar in that it does:</p>

<pre><code>printWriter=new PrintWriter(theServer.getClientSocket().getOutputStream());
</code></pre>

<p>In this manner I would create a new ""buffer"" every time I wished to send a heartbeat, and my messages would never get overwritten.</p>

<p>Unfortuneately this does not seem to be the case.  And I get an message coming through the pipe like this:
  dsgdsbHEARTBEAT#sdg</p>

<p>This causes a core dump later.</p>

<p>Here are my questions:</p>

<p>1) Sockets are obviously not thread safe, but are the PrintWriters I get from them thread safe?  Or is it just returning the same PrintWriter?</p>

<p>2) What is analogous to the socket buffer in Java?  How should I think about this problem?</p>

<p>3) How do I make it so that these threads do not write to the same buffer on the socket? </p>

However, every time something needs to be added to the session 'bucket', it would require saving to the datastore. Obviously that's bad since we want to minimize our writes. Then I thought about using memcache ... seemed like a good idea but then we're faced with issues of possible session corruption due to memcache being ""evicted through memory pressure"" by Google. So does that mean we are left with only the following options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Storing all session data in cookies</li>
<li>Writing all session data to datastore and memcache, and then only reading from memcache</li>
